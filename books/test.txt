Generating the Codebook:
Implement generate_code_book() to create a dictionary where each character maps to a list of page-line-position references.
Scaffolding Tip: First try building the dictionary without using setdefault and enumerating characters.
Note the nested for loops are due to our need to find the page, line, and position for each character in our formatted set of books.
