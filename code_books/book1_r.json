His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people\u2014his imagination had never really acc", "45": "epted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of", "46": " himself.

Eac", "55": "h night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some mo", "58": "nths before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf\u2019s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its feroc", "59": "ious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor\u2019s work with which he was to pay his ", "60": "way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody\u2019s ya", "61": "cht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

To young Gatz, resting on his oa", "3": "rs and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cod", "4": "y\u2014he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometim", "14": "es in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alo", "15": "ne. And it was from Cody that he inherited money\u2014a legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars. He didn\u2019t get it. He never understood ", "16": "the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.

The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of mile", "34": "s over calcareous downs and cornlands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to beh", "35": "old, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills", "36": " are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, th", "37": "e hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and m", "38": "ore delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark gree", "39": "n threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.

Such is the Vale of Blackmoor. The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest. Th", "43": "e Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a curious legend of King Henry III\u2019s reign, in which the kill", "44": "ing by a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a ", "45": "heavy fine.

The MayDay dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon un", "49": "der notice, in the guise of the club revel, or \u201cclubwalking,\u201d as it was there called. It was an interesting event to the younger", "50": " inhabitants of Marlott, though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony. Its singularity lay les", "51": "s in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women. ", "52": "In men\u2019s clubs such celebrations were, though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the softer sex, or a sa", "53": "rcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had denuded such women\u2019s clubs as remained (if any other did) of this their glor", "54": "y and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the local Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as", "55": " benefitclub, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still.

Some approached pure blanching; some had a bluish ", "60": "pallor; some worn by the older characters (which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a cadaverous tint, and", "61": " to a Georgian style. In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled w", "62": "illow wand, and in her left a bunch of white flowers.

But let the elder be passed over here for ", "3": "those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm. The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their ", "4": "heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold, and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a be", "5": "autiful nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude expo", "6": "sure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate selfconsciousness from their features, was appar", "7": "ent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes. And as each and all of them were warmed", "8": " without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least ", "9": "some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. They were all cheerful, a", "10": "nd many of them merry. They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicketgate ", "11": "into the meadows, when one of the women said\u2014 \u201cThe LoadaLord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn\u2019t thy father riding hwome in a", "12": " carriage!\u201d A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was a fine and handsome girl\u2014not handsomer than s", "13": "ome others, possibly\u2014but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape. She wore a red ribb", "14": "on in her hair, and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment. As she looked round Du", "15": "rbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzleheaded brawny damsel with he", "16": "r gownsleeves rolled above her elbows. This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned", "17": " groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his head,", "18": " and singing in a slow recitative\u2014 \u201cI\u2019vegotagr\u2019tfamilyvaultatKingsbere\u2014and knightedforefathersinleadcoffinsthere!\u201d The clubbists", "19": " tittered, except the girl called Tess\u2014in whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolis", "20": "h in their eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s tired, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said hastily, \u201cand he has got a lift home, because our own horse has to rest toda", "21": "y.\u201d \u201cBless thy simplicity, Tess,\u201d said her companions. \u201cHe\u2019s got his marketnitch.

By the time the spo", "26": "t was reached she had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual.

The poutedup deep red mouth to which this", "30": " syllable was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape, and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the middle of h", "31": "er top one upward, when they closed together after a word. Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. As she walked alo", "32": "ng today, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkl", "33": "ing from her eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then. Yet few knew, and still fewer consid", "34": "ered this. A small minority, mainly strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow momentarily fascinated by", "35": " her freshness, and wonder if they would ever see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl", "36": ", and no more. Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and", "37": " the club having entered the allotted space, dancing began. As there were no men in the company, the girls danced at first with ", "38": "each other, but when the hour for the close of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of the village, together with other idl", "39": "ers and pedestrians, gathered round the spot, and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner. Among these onlookers were three", "40": " young men of a superior class, carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout sticks in their hands. Their gen", "41": "eral likeness to each other, and their consecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might be, what in fact they were,", "42": " brothers. The eldest wore the white tie, high waistcoat, and thinbrimmed hat of the regulation curate; the second was the norma", "43": "l undergraduate; the appearance of the third and youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there was an un", "44": "cribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groo", "45": "ve.

These three bre", "46": "thren told casual acquaintance that they were spending their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of Blackmoor, t", "47": "heir course being southwesterly from the town of Shaston on the northeast. They leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired", "48": " as to the meaning of the dance and the whitefrocked maids. The two elder of the brothers were plainly not intending to linger m", "49": "ore than a moment, but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to amuse the third, and make him in", "50": " no hurry to move on. He unstrapped his knapsack, put it, with his stick, on the hedgebank, and opened the gate. \u201cWhat are you g", "51": "oing to do, Angel?\u201d asked the eldest. \u201cI am inclined to go and have a fling with them.

The church c", "6": "lock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must leave\u2014he had been forgetting himself\u2014he had to join his companions. As ", "7": "he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield, whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect", "8": " of reproach that he had not chosen her. He, too, was sorry then that, owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and w", "9": "ith that in his mind he left the pasture. On account of his long delay he started in a flyingrun down the lane westward, and had", "10": " soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise. He had not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath, and looke", "11": "d back. He could see the white figures of the girls in the green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among ", "12": "them. They seemed to have quite forgotten him already. All of them, except, perhaps, one. This white shape stood apart by the he", "13": "dge alone. From her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with whom he had not danced.

Everything grew more an", "58": "d more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed.

Something te", "62": "rrible had happened. The harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way. In consternation Tess jumped down, and disc", "63": "overed the dreadful truth. The groan had proceeded from her father\u2019s poor horse Prince. The morning mailcart, with its two noise", "64": "less wheels, speeding along these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage. The po"}, "44": {"1": "inted shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his life\u2019s blood was spout", "2": "ing in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the road.

By this time the mailcart man had joi", "5": "ned her, and began dragging and unharnessing the hot form of Prince. But he was already dead, and, seeing that nothing more coul", "6": "d be done immediately, the mailcart man returned to his own animal, which was uninjured. \u201cYou was on the wrong side,\u201d he said. \u201c", "7": "I am bound to go on with the mailbags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your load. I\u2019ll send somebody to h", "8": "elp you as soon as I can. It is getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear.\u201d He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stoo", "9": "d and waited. The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all it", "10": "s white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescenc", "11": "e of coagulation; and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside, still and stark; ", "12": "his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him. \u201c\u2019Tis all my ", "13": "doing\u2014all mine!\u201d the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle. \u201cNo excuse for me\u2014none. What will mother and father live on now? Aby, ", "14": "Aby!\u201d She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole disaster. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on with our load\u2014Prince is killed!\u201d Wh", "15": "en Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face. \u201cWhy, I danced and laughed only yesterd", "16": "ay!\u201d she went on to herself. \u201cTo think that I was such a fool!\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn", "17": "\u2019t it, Tess?\u201d murmured Abraham through his tears. In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At length a s", "18": "ound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the driver of the mailcar had been as good as his word. A farmer\u2019s man from", "19": " near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load", "20": " taken on towards Casterbridge. The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot of the accident. Prince ha", "21": "d lain there in the ditch since the morning; but the place of the bloodpool was still visible in the middle of the road, though ", "22": "scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles. All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly haul", "23": "ed, and with his hoofs in the air, and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott", "24": ". Tess had gone back earlier. How to break the news was more than she could think. It was a relief to her tongue to find from th", "25": "e faces of her parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not lessen the selfreproach which she continued to ", "26": "heap upon herself for her negligence. But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one ", "27": "to them than it would have been to a thriving family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it would only h", "28": "ave meant inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl ", "29": "from parents more ambitious for her welfare. Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself. When it was discovered that the knacker a", "30": "nd tanner would give only a very few shillings for Prince\u2019s carcase because of his decrepitude, Durbeyfield rose to the occasion", "31": ". \u201cNo,\u201d said he stoically, \u201cI won\u2019t sell his old body. When we d\u2019Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn\u2019t sell our charger", "32": "s for cat\u2019s meat. Let \u2019em keep their shillings! He\u2019ve served me well in his lifetime, and I won\u2019t part from him now.\u201d He worked ", "33": "harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family. Whe", "34": "n the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it, the children ", "35": "following in funeral train. Abraham and \u2019LizaLu sobbed, Hope and Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed fro", "36": "m the walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave. The breadwinner had been taken away from them; what w", "37": "ould they do? \u201cIs he gone to heaven?\u201d asked Abraham, between the sobs. Then Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth, and the ch", "38": "ildren cried anew. All except Tess. Her face was dry and pale, as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess. V The", "39": " haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became disorganized forthwith. Distress, if not penury, loomed in th", "40": "e distance. Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slacktwisted fellow; he had good strength to work at times; but the times ", "41": "could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and, having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the dayla", "42": "bourer, he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide. Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents in", "43": "to this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme. \u201cWe ", "44": "must take the ups wi\u2019 the downs, Tess,\u201d said she; \u201cand never could your high blood have been found out at a more calledfor momen", "45": "t. You must try your friends. Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs d\u2019Urberville living on the outskirts o\u2019 The Chase, who mu", "46": "st be our relation? You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in our trouble.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care to do that,\u201d says", "47": " Tess. \u201cIf there is such a lady, \u2019twould be enough for us if she were friendly\u2014not to expect her to give us help.\u201d \u201cYou could wi", "48": "n her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps there\u2019s more in it than you know of. I\u2019ve heard what I\u2019ve heard, goodnow.\u201d", "49": " The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the materna", "50": "l wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, suc", "51": "h doubtful profit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that this Mrs d\u2019Urberville was a lady of unequalled", "52": " virtues and charity. But Tess\u2019s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her. \u201cI\u2019d rather try to get ", "53": "work,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDurbeyfield, you can settle it,\u201d said his wife, turning to where he sat in the background. \u201cIf you say she", "54": " ought to go, she will go.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin,\u201d murmured he. \u201cI\u2019m th", "55": "e head of the noblest branch o\u2019 the family, and I ought to live up to it.\u201d His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than ", "56": "her own objections to going. \u201cWell, as I killed the horse, mother,\u201d she said mournfully, \u201cI suppose I ought to do something. I d", "57": "on\u2019t mind going and seeing her, but you must leave it to me about asking for help. And don\u2019t go thinking about her making a matc", "58": "h for me\u2014it is silly.\u201d \u201cVery well said, Tess!\u201d observed her father sententiously. \u201cWho said I had such a thought?\u201d asked Joan. \u201c", "59": "I fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I\u2019ll go.\u201d Rising early next day she walked to the hilltown called Shaston, and there too", "60": "k advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish in w", "61": "hich the vague and mysterious Mrs d\u2019Urberville had her residence. Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s route on this memorable morning lay amid th", "62": "e northeastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and in which her life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was", "63": " to her the world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in", "64": " the wondering days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now. She had seen da"}, "45": {"1": "ily from her chamberwindow towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all, the town of Shaston standing majestically on its h", "2": "eight; its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun. She had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract even of the ", "3": "Vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection. Much less had she been far outside the valley. Every contour of th", "4": "e surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives\u2019 faces; but for what lay beyond, her judgment was dependent ", "5": "on the teaching of the village school, where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving, a year or two before this ", "6": "date. In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as", "7": " one of three\u2014all nearly of the same year\u2014walking home from school side by side; Tess the middle one\u2014in a pink print pinafore, o", "8": "f a finely reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary\u2014marching on", "9": " upon long stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladderlike holes at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and ban", "10": "ks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earthcoloured hair hanging like pothooks; the arms of the two outside ", "11": "girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters. As Tess grew older, and began to see how", "12": " matters stood, she felt quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers,", "13": " when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them. Her mother\u2019s intelligence was that of a happy child: Joan Durbeyfield", "14": " was simply an additional one, and that not the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on Providence. However, Tess became hu", "15": "manely beneficent towards the small ones, and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left school, to lend a h", "16": "and at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by preference, at milking or buttermaking processes, which she had lea", "17": "rnt when her father had owned cows; and being deftfingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.

It was more, far more; a countryhouse built for enjoyment pure and ", "24": "simple, with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes, and for a little ", "25": "fancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and tended by a bailiff. The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in d", "26": "ense evergreens.

It was of recent erection\u2014indeed almost new\u2014an", "28": "d of the same rich red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge.

Everything looked like money\u2014like the last coin issued from the Mint. The stables, partly scre", "35": "ened by Austrian pines and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as ChapelsofEase. On the exte", "36": "nsive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its door being towards her. Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a halfalarmed attitud", "37": "e, on the edge of the gravel sweep. Her feet had brought her onward to this point before she had quite realized where she was; a", "38": "nd now all was contrary to her expectation. \u201cI thought we were an old family; but this is all new!\u201d she said, in her artlessness", "39": ".

Yet he was not an extravagantminded man in this, and in constructing hi", "52": "s family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his intermarriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a singl", "53": "e title above a rank of strict moderation.

Her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther, and bidding t", "50": "hem a hasty goodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill. They saw her white shape draw near to the springcart, on which her box was", "51": " already placed. But before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round th", "52": "e bend of the road there, passed the luggagecart, and halted beside Tess, who looked up as if in great surprise. Her mother perc", "53": "eived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spickandspan gig or dogcart", "54": ", highly varnished and equipped. The driver was a young man of three or fourandtwenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a", "55": " dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth, stickup collar, and brown drivinggloves\u2014in short, he was the", "56": " handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before to get her answer about Tess.

Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this? \u201cIs dat the gentl", "58": "emankinsman who\u2019ll make Sissy a lady?\u201d asked the youngest child. Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing stil", "59": "l, undecided, beside this turnout, whose owner was talking to her. Her seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it", "60": " was misgiving. She would have preferred the humble cart. The young man dismounted, and appeared to urge her to ascend. She turn", "61": "ed her face down the hill to her relatives, and regarded the little group. Something seemed to quicken her to a determination; p", "62": "ossibly the thought that she had killed Prince. She suddenly stepped up; he mounted beside her, and immediately whipped on the h", "63": "orse. In a moment they had passed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill. Directly Tess was", "64": " out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end, the little ones\u2019 eyes filled with tears. The youngest ch"}, "49": {"1": "ild said, \u201cI wish poor, poor Tess wasn\u2019t gone away to be a lady!\u201d and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying.

Rising still, an immense lan", "13": "dscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew noth", "14": "ing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in ", "15": "a long straight descent of nearly a mile. Ever since the accident with her father\u2019s horse Tess Durbeyfield, courageous as she na", "16": "turally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her. She began to get uneasy at a c", "17": "ertain recklessness in her conductor\u2019s driving. \u201cYou will go down slow, sir, I suppose?\u201d she said with attempted unconcern. D\u2019Ur", "18": "berville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of his large white centreteeth, and allowed his lips to smile slo", "19": "wly of themselves. \u201cWhy, Tess,\u201d he answered, after another whiff or two, \u201cit isn\u2019t a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that?", "20": " Why, I always go down at full gallop. There\u2019s nothing like it for raising your spirits.\u201d \u201cBut perhaps you need not now?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d ", "21": "he said, shaking his head, \u201cthere are two to be reckoned with.

It was my fate", "25": ", I suppose. Tib has killed one chap; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me. And then, take my word for it, I nearly ", "26": "killed her. But she\u2019s touchy still, very touchy; and one\u2019s life is hardly safe behind her sometimes.\u201d They were just beginning t", "27": "o descend; and it was evident that the horse, whether of her own will or of his (the latter being the more likely), knew so well", "28": " the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly required a hint from behind. Down, down, they sped, the wheels humming", "29": " like a top, the dogcart rocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in relation to the line of progress; ", "30": "the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off the ground, it seemed, for many", "31": " yards; sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse\u2019s hoofs outshone the daylight. The ", "32": "aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each", "33": " shoulder. The wind blew through Tess\u2019s white muslin to her very skin, and her washed hair flew out behind. She was determined t", "34": "o show no open fear, but she clutched d\u2019Urberville\u2019s reinarm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do!

Recovering her reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the summi", "39": "t of another declivity. \u201cNow then, again!\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. \u201cNo, no!\u201d said Tess. \u201cShow more sense, do, please.\u201d \u201cBut when peop", "40": "le find themselves on one of the highest points in the county, they must get down again,\u201d he retorted. He loosened rein, and awa", "41": "y they went a second time. D\u2019Urberville turned his face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery: \u201cNow then, put you", "42": "r arms round my waist again, as you did before, my Beauty.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Tess independently, holding on as well as she could wi", "43": "thout touching him. \u201cLet me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on that warmed cheek, and I\u2019ll stop\u2014on my", "44": " honour, I will!\u201d Tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat, at which he urged the horse anew, and roc", "45": "ked her the more. \u201cWill nothing else do?\u201d she cried at length, in desperation, her large eyes staring at him like those of a wil", "46": "d animal. This dressing her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose. \u201cNothing, dear Tess,\u201d he rep", "47": "lied. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2014very well; I don\u2019t mind!\u201d she panted miserably. He drew rein, and as they slowed he was on the point of ", "48": "imprinting the desired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty, she dodged aside. His arms being occupied with t", "49": "he reins there was left him no power to prevent her man\u0153uvre. \u201cNow, damn it\u2014I\u2019ll break both our necks!\u201d swore her capriciously p", "50": "assionate companion. \u201cSo you can go from your word like that, you young witch, can you?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Tess, \u201cI\u2019ll not move ", "51": "since you be so determined!

No sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame, took out her handkerchief, and wiped ", "55": "the spot on her cheek that had been touched by his lips. His ardour was nettled at the sight, for the act on her part had been u", "56": "nconsciously done. \u201cYou are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!\u201d said the young man. Tess made no reply to this remark, of whic", "57": "h, indeed, she did not quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her cheek", "58": ". She had, in fact, undone the kiss, as far as such a thing was physically possible. With a dim sense that he was vexed she look", "59": "ed steadily ahead as they trotted on near Melbury Down and Wingreen, till she saw, to her consternation, that there was yet anot", "60": "her descent to be undergone. \u201cYou shall be made sorry for that!\u201d he resumed, his injured tone still remaining, as he flourished ", "61": "the whip anew. \u201cUnless, that is, you agree willingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief.\u201d She sighed. \u201cVery well, sir!\u201d ", "62": "she said. \u201cOh\u2014let me get my hat!\u201d At the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road, their present speed on the upla", "63": "nd being by no means slow. D\u2019Urberville pulled up, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the other side. She tu", "64": "rned back and picked up the article. \u201cYou look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, contemplating h"}, "50": {"1": "er over the back of the vehicle. \u201cNow then, up again! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d The hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not steppe", "2": "d forward. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her eye lit in defiant triumph; \u201cnot again, if I kno", "3": "w it!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014you won\u2019t get up beside me?\u201d \u201cNo; I shall walk.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if \u2019tis ", "4": "dozens. Besides, the cart is behind.\u201d \u201cYou artful hussy! Now, tell me\u2014didn\u2019t you make that hat blow off on purpose? I\u2019ll swear y", "5": "ou did!\u201d Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion. Then d\u2019Urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything he ", "6": "could think of for the trick. Turning the horse suddenly he tried to drive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and ", "7": "the hedge. But he could not do this short of injuring her. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!\u201d cr", "8": "ied Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled. \u201cI don\u2019t like \u2019ee at all! I hate and detest you! I", "9": "\u2019ll go back to mother, I will!\u201d D\u2019Urberville\u2019s bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he laughed heartily. \u201cWell, I like yo", "10": "u all the better,\u201d he said. \u201cCome, let there be peace. I\u2019ll never do it any more against your will. My life upon it now!\u201d Still ", "11": "Tess could not be induced to remount. She did not, however, object to his keeping his gig alongside her; and in this manner, at ", "12": "a slow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge. From time to time d\u2019Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress", "13": " at the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour. She might in truth have safely trusted him now", "14": "; but he had forfeited her confidence for the time, and she kept on the ground progressing thoughtfully, as if wondering whether", "15": " it would be wiser to return home. Her resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed vacillating even to childishness to aband", "16": "on it now, unless for graver reasons. How could she face her parents, get back her box, and disconcert the whole scheme for the ", "17": "rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds? A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and i", "18": "n a snug nook to the right the poultryfarm and cottage of Tess\u2019s destination. IX The community of fowls to which Tess had been a", "19": "ppointed as supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enc", "20": "losure that had once been a garden, but was now a trampled and sanded square. The house was overrun with ivy, its chimney being ", "21": "enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower. The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds, w", "22": "ho walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty copyhold", "23": "ers who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their fami", "24": "ly when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers\u2019 money, and had been in their poss", "25": "ession for several generations before the d\u2019Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently turned into a fowlhouse by Mrs St", "26": "oked\u2019Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law. \u201c\u2019Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather\u2019s time", "27": ",\u201d they said. The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. ", "28": "Distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists. The chimneycorner and once", "29": "blazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs; while out of doors the plots that each ", "30": "succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion. The garden in which the co", "31": "ttage stood was surrounded by a wall, and could only be entered through a door. When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the", "32": " next morning in altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poultere", "33": "r, the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered. She had come from the manorhouse. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville", "34": " wants the fowls as usual,\u201d she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, \u201cMis\u2019ess is a old lady, ", "35": "and blind.\u201d \u201cBlind!\u201d said Tess. Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her comp", "36": "anion\u2019s direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maidservant, who had likewise taken ", "37": "two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its", "38": " chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures\u2014feathers floating within view of the front, and hencoops standing on the gras", "39": "s. In a sittingroom on the groundfloor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the e", "40": "state, a whitehaired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those ", "41": "whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien app", "42": "arent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201c", "43": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be", "44": " kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so", "45": " lively today, is he? He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose. And Phena too\u2014yes, they are a little frightened\u2014a", "46": "ren\u2019t you, dears? But they will soon get used to you.\u201d While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedienc", "47": "e to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beak", "48": "s, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and t", "49": "o discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled. She handled their crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too litt", "50": "le or too much; her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind. The birds that the two girls had brou", "51": "ght in were duly returned to the yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the ol", "52": "d woman\u2014Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then\u2014her perception of each", "53": " visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees. It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d\u2019Urber", "54": "ville was the bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the maidservant the parson and curate of the parish ", "55": "bringing them up. At the end of the ceremony Mrs d\u2019Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling and twitching her face into undulat", "56": "ions, \u201cCan you whistle?\u201d \u201cWhistle, Ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cYes, whistle tunes.\u201d Tess could whistle like most other countrygirls, though the acc", "57": "omplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company. However, she blandly admitted that such was the fact. ", "58": "\u201cThen you will have to practise it every day. I had a lad who did it very well, but he has left. I want you to whistle to my bul", "59": "lfinches; as I cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach \u2019em airs that way. Tell her where the cages are, Elizabeth.

Pooh!\u201d The old lady\u2019s face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she ma", "62": "de no further reply. Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the birds were taken back to their quar", "63": "ters. The girl\u2019s surprise at Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s manner was not great; for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no", "64": " more. But she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the socalled kinship. She gathered that no g"}, "51": {"1": "reat affection flowed between the blind woman and her son. But in that, too, she was mistaken. Mrs d\u2019Urberville was not the firs", "2": "t mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully, and to be bitterly fond. In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day ", "3": "before, Tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone, now that she was once in", "4": "stalled there; and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of", "5": " retaining her post. As soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop, and seriously screwed up ", "6": "her mouth for the longneglected practice. She found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of", "7": " wind through the lips, and no clear note at all.

Her first day\u2019s experiences ", "31": "were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A familiarity with Alec d\u2019Urberville\u2019s presence\u2014which ", "32": "that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone\u2014rem", "33": "oved much of her original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and ten", "34": "derer kind. But she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her, owing to her unavoidable dep", "35": "endence upon his mother, and, through that lady\u2019s comparative helplessness, upon him. She soon found that whistling to the bullf", "36": "inches in Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art, for she had caught from her musica", "37": "l mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden", "38": " was this whistling by the cages each morning. Unrestrained by the young man\u2019s presence she threw up her mouth, put her lips nea", "39": "r the bars, and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners. Mrs d\u2019Urberville slept in a large fourpost bedstead hung", "40": " with heavy damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment, where they flitted about freely at certain hours, ", "41": "and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at the window where the cages were ranged, givi", "42": "ng her lesson as usual, she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed.

Thereupon her whistling beca", "44": "me so disjointed that the listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of his presence.

The levity of some of the younger women in and about Trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit ", "48": "who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity. The place had also a more abiding defect; it drank hard. The staple conversation on the f", "49": "arms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and smockfrocked arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would ent", "50": "er into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which ", "51": "could result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.

This h", "61": "ad gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in September, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims ", "62": "from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account. Tess\u2019s occupations made her late in setting out, so that her", "63": " comrades reached the town long before her.

Through this lowlit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along. She did not discover the coi", "2": "ncidence of the market with the fair till she had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. Her limited marketing", "3": " was soon completed; and then as usual she began to look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers. At first she could not find", "4": " them, and she was informed that most of them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of a haytrusser and", "5": " peatdealer who had transactions with their farm.

She told", "7": " him that she was simply waiting for company homeward. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again,\u201d said he over her shoulder as she went on down the b", "8": "ack lane.

It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist ", "13": "of yellow radiance, which at first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke. But on drawing nearer she perceived that it was a cloud", "14": " of dust, lit by candles within the outhouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the doorway into the wide", "15": " night of the garden.

This is all but the last jig.\u201d She waited. The reel drew to a close, and ", "29": "some of the party were in the mind of starting. But others would not, and another dance was formed. This surely would end it, th", "30": "ought Tess. But it merged in yet another. She became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so long, it was necessary to wait l", "31": "onger; on account of the fair the roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and, though not fearful of me", "32": "asurable dangers, she feared the unknown. Had she been near Marlott she would have had less dread. \u201cDon\u2019t ye be nervous, my dear", "33": " good soul,\u201d expostulated, between his coughs, a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon his head that the ", "34": "brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint. \u201cWhat\u2019s yer hurry? Tomorrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep it off in churc", "35": "htime. Now, have a turn with me?\u201d She did not abhor dancing, but she was not going to dance here. The movement grew more passion", "36": "ate: the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or ", "37": "with the back of the bow. But it did not matter; the panting shapes spun onwards. They did not vary their partners if their incl", "38": "ination were to stick to previous ones. Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory choice had not as yet been arrived at", "39": " by one or other of the pair, and by this time every couple had been suitably matched. It was then that the ecstasy and the drea", "40": "m began, in which emotion was the matter of the universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you from spi", "41": "nning where you wanted to spin. Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen, and lay in a mixed heap. The", "42": " next couple, unable to check its progress, came toppling over the obstacle.

He beckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him. \u201cWell, my Bea", "50": "uty, what are you doing here?\u201d She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her trouble to him\u2014that she ha", "51": "d been waiting ever since he saw her to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to her. \u201cBut it seems the", "52": "y will never leave off, and I really think I will wait no longer.\u201d \u201cCertainly do not. I have only a saddlehorse here today; but ", "53": "come to The FlowerdeLuce, and I\u2019ll hire a trap, and drive you home with me.\u201d Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over he", "54": "r original mistrust of him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk home with the workfolk.

Yet however terrestrial", "2": " and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was different.

They were a", "5": "s sublime as the moon and stars above them, and the moon and stars were as ardent as they. Tess, however, had undergone such pai", "6": "nful experiences of this kind in her father\u2019s house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the pleasure she was beginning ", "7": "to feel in the moonlight journey. Yet she stuck to the party, for reasons above given. In the open highway they had progressed i", "8": "n scattered order; but now their route was through a fieldgate, and the foremost finding a difficulty in opening it, they closed", "9": " up together. This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a wickerbasket containing her mother\u2019s groceries,", "10": " her own draperies, and other purchases for the week. The basket being large and heavy, Car had placed it for convenience of por", "11": "terage on the top of her head, where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo. \u201cWell\u2014whatever is that ac", "12": "reeping down thy back, Car Darch?\u201d said one of the group suddenly. All looked at Car.

No; it was not her hair: it was a black stream of something oozing from her basket, and it", "15": " glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays of the moon. \u201c\u2019Tis treacle,\u201d said an observant matron. Treacle it was. Car\u2019", "16": "s poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet stuff. Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but treacle was what he", "17": "r soul desired, and Car had been about to give her a treat of surprise. Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the", "18": " vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within. By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary app", "19": "earance of Car\u2019s back, which irritated the dark queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available,", "20": " and independently of the help of the scoffers.

She knew well enough that the better among them would repent of their passion next day. They were a", "41": "ll now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of th", "42": "e hedge that screened the road, and Alec d\u2019Urberville looked round upon them. \u201cWhat the devil is all this row about, workfolk?\u201d ", "43": "he asked. The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did not require any. Having heard their voices while ye", "44": "t some way off he had ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself. Tess was standing apart from the rest, ne", "45": "ar the gate.

The field had already been \u201copened\u201d; that is to say, a lane a few feet wide had been handcut through t", "31": "he wheat along the whole circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and machine.

The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each circuit, and the standing corn was redu", "41": "ced to a smaller area as the morning wore on.

She br", "63": "ings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted ", "64": "by the breeze.

On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages ranging from six to fourteen, rose over t", "14": "he stubbly convexity of the hill.

The eldest of the comers, a gi", "15": "rl who wore a triangular shawl, its corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first sight seemed to be a doll", "16": ", but proved to be an infant in long clothes. Another brought some lunch. The harvesters ceased working, took their provisions, ", "17": "and sat down against one of the shocks. Here they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a cup. Tess Durb", "18": "eyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours.

Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still ris", "23": "ing colour, unfastened her frock and began suckling the child. The men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards ", "24": "the other end of the field, some of them beginning to smoke; one, with absentminded fondness, regretfully stroking the jar that ", "25": "would no longer yield a stream. All the women but Tess fell into animated talk, and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair", "26": ".

She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a struct", "47": "ure of sensations, to anybody but herself. To all humankind besides, Tess was only a passing thought.

This was why she had borne hersel", "56": "f with dignity, and had looked people calmly in the face at times, even when holding the baby in her arms. The harvestmen rose f", "57": "rom the shock of corn, and stretched their limbs, and extinguished their pipes.

The bird\u2019se", "46": "ye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it was more c", "47": "heering. It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear, braci", "48": "ng, ethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in Bla", "49": "ckmoor. Those were slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish un", "50": "awares. The Froom waters were clear as the pure River of Life shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the shadow of a cloud, with pebb", "51": "ly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long.

Her", "55": " face had latterly changed with changing states of mind, continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as t", "56": "he thoughts were gay or grave.

It was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind. The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency t", "59": "o find sweet pleasure somewhere, which pervades all life, from the meanest to the highest, had at length mastered Tess. Being ev", "60": "en now only a young woman of twenty, one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing, it was impossible that any eve", "61": "nt should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation. And thus her spirits, and her thankful", "62": "ness, and her hopes, rose higher and higher. She tried several ballads, but found them inadequate; till, recollecting the psalte", "63": "r that her eyes had so often wandered over of a Sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge, she chanted: \u201cO ye", "64": " Sun and Moon ... O ye Stars ... ye Green Things upon the Earth ... ye Fowls of the Air ... Beasts and Cattle ... Children of Me"}, "63": {"1": "n ... bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him forever!\u201d She suddenly stopped and murmured: \u201cBut perhaps I don\u2019t quite know", "2": " the Lord as yet.\u201d And probably the halfunconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic utterance in a Monotheistic setting; women whose ", "3": "chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far more of the Pagan fantasy of their remote ", "4": "forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date. However, Tess found at least approximate expressi", "5": "on for her feelings in the old _Benedicite_ that she had lisped from infancy; and it was enough. Such high contentment with such", "6": " a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the Durbeyfield temp", "7": "erament. Tess really wished to walk uprightly, while her father did nothing of the kind; but she resembled him in being content ", "8": "with immediate and small achievements, and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could", "9": " alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful d\u2019Urbervilles were now. There was, it might be said, ", "10": "the energy of her mother\u2019s unexpended family, as well as the natural energy of Tess\u2019s years, rekindled after the experience whic", "11": "h had so overwhelmed her for the time.

As they had been discussing a score of personal ", "15": "matters only halfanhour before, the introductory style seemed a little superfluous.

The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along the lowe", "43": "st levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain ", "44": "had been to flood the lane overshoe to a distance of some fifty yards.

Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adop", "58": "t the safe phrase of evasive controversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer d", "59": "ays.

That\u2019s well done.\u201d Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and Angel strode off with her, his sli", "9": "m figure, as viewed from behind, looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They disappeared round the c", "10": "urve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian\u2019s bonnet told where they were. In a few minutes he", "11": " reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank. \u201cHere he comes,\u201d she murmured, and they could hear that her lips wer", "12": "e dry with emotion. \u201cAnd I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in that,\u201d ", "13": "said Tess quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s a time for everything,\u201d continued Izz, unheeding. \u201cA time to embrace, and a time to refrain from emb", "14": "racing; the first is now going to be mine.\u201d \u201cFie\u2014it is Scripture, Izz!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Izz, \u201cI\u2019ve always a\u2019 ear at church for prett", "15": "y verses.\u201d Angel Clare, to whom threequarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She qui", "16": "etly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched off with her. When he was heard returning for th", "17": "e third time Retty\u2019s throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the redhaired girl, and while he was seizi", "18": "ng her he glanced at Tess. His lips could not have pronounced more plainly, \u201cIt will soon be you and I.\u201d Her comprehension appea", "19": "red in her face; she could not help it. There was an understanding between them. Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest w", "20": "eight, was the most troublesome of Clare\u2019s burdens. Marian had been like a sack of meal, a dead weight of plumpness under which ", "21": "he has literally staggered. Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics. However, he got through with the", "22": " disquieted creature, deposited her, and returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group, standing as he ha", "23": "d placed them on the next rising ground. It was now her turn. She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity o", "24": "f Mr Clare\u2019s breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betray", "25": "ing her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment. \u201cI may be able to clim\u2019 along the bank perhaps\u2014I can clim\u2019 better than", "26": " they. You must be so tired, Mr Clare!\u201d \u201cNo, no, Tess,\u201d said he quickly. And almost before she was aware, she was seated in his ", "27": "arms and resting against his shoulder. \u201cThree Leahs to get one Rachel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey are better women than I,\u201d she replie", "28": "d, magnanimously sticking to her resolve. \u201cNot to me,\u201d said Angel. He saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in sil", "29": "ence. \u201cI hope I am not too heavy?\u201d she said timidly. \u201cO no. You should lift Marian! Such a lump.

The water came up so sudden.\u201d That the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer ", "33": "to, the state of breathing belied. Clare stood still and inclinced his face towards hers. \u201cO Tessy!\u201d he exclaimed. The girl\u2019s ch", "34": "eeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into his eyes for her emotion. It reminded Angel that he was somewhat unfairly", "35": " taking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no further with it. No definite words of love had crossed their lips as", "36": " yet, and suspension at this point was desirable now. However, he walked slowly, to make the remainder of the distance as long a", "37": "s possible; but at last they came to the bend, and the rest of their progress was in full view of the other three. The dry land ", "38": "was reached, and he set her down. Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him, and she could see that the", "39": "y had been talking of her. He hastily bade them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road. The four moved ", "40": "on together as before, till Marian broke the silence by saying\u2014 \u201cNo\u2014in all truth; we have no chance against her!\u201d She looked joy", "41": "lessly at Tess. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked the latter. \u201cHe likes \u2019ee best\u2014the very best!

The gaiety with which they had set", "43": " out had somehow vanished; and yet there was no enmity or malice between them. They were generous young souls; they had been rea", "44": "red in the lonely country nooks where fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her. Such supplanting was to be.

The incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out, and", "61": " the torture was almost more than they could endure. The differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by ", "62": "this passion, and each was but portion of one organism called sex.

The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings. July passed", "20": " over their heads, and the Thermidorean weather which came in its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state", "21": " of hearts at Talbothays Dairy. The air of the place, so fresh in the spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now. ", "22": "Its heavy scents weighed upon them, and at midday the landscape seemed lying in a swoon. Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper s", "23": "lopes of the pastures, but there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses purled. And as Clare was oppressed b", "24": "y the outward heats, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent Tess. The rains having pas", "25": "sed, the uplands were dry. The wheels of the dairyman\u2019s springcart, as he sped home from market, licked up the pulverized surfac", "26": "e of the highway, and were followed by white ribands of dust, as if they had set a thin powdertrain on fire. The cows jumped wil", "27": "dly over the fivebarred bartongate, maddened by the gadfly; Dairyman Crick kept his shirtsleeves permanently rolled up from Mond", "28": "ay to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation without open doors, and in the dairygarden the blackbirds and thrushes", "29": " crept about under the currantbushes, rather in the manner of quadrupeds than of winged creatures. The flies in the kitchen were", "30": " lazy, teasing, and familiar, crawling about in the unwonted places, on the floors, into drawers, and over the backs of the milk", "31": "maids\u2019 hands.

Whose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid\u2019s. It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the obscure da", "38": "iry had become to him. And though new love was to be held partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides Angel ", "39": "have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The i", "40": "mpressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he found that", "41": " life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere. Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man wi", "42": "th a conscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss; but a woman living her precious life\u2014a life which, ", "43": "to herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself. Upon her sensation", "44": "s the whole world depended to Tess; through her existence all her fellowcreatures existed, to her. The universe itself only came", "45": " into being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which she was born. This consciousness upon which he had in", "46": "truded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause\u2014her all; her every and on", "47": "ly chance. How then should he look upon her as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle to caress and grow weary of;", "48": " and not deal in the greatest seriousness with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in her\u2014so fervid and so impressi", "49": "onable as she was under her reserve\u2014in order that it might not agonize and wreck her? To encounter her daily in the accustomed m", "50": "anner would be to develop what had begun.

As yet the harm done was small. But it was not easy to carry o", "53": "ut the resolution never to approach her. He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.

After that the blackness of unutterable night. At this moment o", "5": "f the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of his father", "6": "\u2019s Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could, a little basket which contained some blackpuddings and a bottle of mead", "7": ", sent by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents. The white lane stretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but", "8": " they were staring into next year, and not at the lane. He loved her; ought he to marry her? Dared he to marry her? What would h", "9": "is mother and his brothers say? What would he himself say a couple of years after the event? That would depend upon whether the ", "10": "germs of staunch comradeship underlay the temporary emotion, or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only, with no substra", "11": "tum of everlastingness. His father\u2019s hillsurrounded little town, the Tudor churchtower of red stone, the clump of trees near the", "12": " Vicarage, came at last into view beneath him, and he rode down towards the wellknown gate. Casting a glance in the direction of", "13": " the church before entering his home, he beheld standing by the vestrydoor a group of girls, of ages between twelve and sixteen,", "14": " apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat older than the schoolgirls", "15": ", wearing a broadbrimmed hat and highlystarched cambric morninggown, with a couple of books in her hand. Clare knew her well. He", "16": " could not be sure that she observed him; he hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and speak to he", "17": "r, blameless creature that she was. An overpowering reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him. The young", "18": " lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his father\u2019s neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents\u2019 quiet hope that he ", "19": "might wed some day. She was great at Antinomianism and Bibleclasses, and was plainly going to hold a class now. Clare\u2019s mind fle", "20": "w to the impassioned, summersteeped heathens in the Var Vale, their rosy faces courtpatched with cowdroppings; and to one the mo", "21": "st impassioned of them all. It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over to Emminster, and hence had no", "22": "t written to apprise his mother and father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour, before they should have gone ou", "23": "t to their parish duties. He was a little late, and they had already sat down to the morning meal. The group at the table jumped", "24": " up to welcome him as soon as he entered. They were his father and mother, his brother the Reverend Felix\u2014curate at a town in th", "25": "e adjoining county, home for the inside of a fortnight\u2014and his other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the classical scholar, and ", "26": "Fellow and Dean of his College, down from Cambridge for the long vacation. His mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles, a", "27": "nd his father looked what in fact he was\u2014an earnest, Godfearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixtyfive, his pale face lin", "28": "ed with thought and purpose. Over their heads hung the picture of Angel\u2019s sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen years his se", "29": "nior, who had married a missionary and gone out to Africa. Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty ", "30": "years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. A spiritual descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Cal", "31": "vin; an Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw y", "32": "outh made up his mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted no further reasoning on them thenceforward", "33": ". He was regarded even by those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on the other hand, those totally oppos", "34": "ed to him were unwillingly won to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he showed in dismissing all ques", "35": "tion as to principles in his energy for applying them. He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St James as much as he dare", "36": "d, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. The New Testament was less a Christiad then a Pauliad to his i", "37": "ntelligence\u2014less an argument than an intoxication. His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice, and quit", "38": "e amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. He d", "39": "espised the Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles, and deemed himself consistent through the whole category\u2014which in a way he", "40": " might have been. One thing he certainly was\u2014sincere. To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush womanh", "41": "ood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var Vale, his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had ", "42": "he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it. Once upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his fathe", "43": "r, in a moment of irritation, that it might have resulted far better for mankind if Greece had been the source of the religion o", "44": "f modern civilization, and not Palestine; and his father\u2019s grief was of that blank description which could not realize that ther", "45": "e might lurk a thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth, in such a proposition. He had simply preache", "46": "d austerely at Angel for some time after. But the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long, and w", "47": "elcomed his son today with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a child\u2019s. Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet h", "48": "e did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there. Every time that he returned hither he was conscious", "49": " of this divergence, and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than", "50": " usual. Its transcendental aspirations\u2014still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things, a zenithal paradise, a nadira", "51": "l hell\u2014were as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet. Latterly he had seen only Life, fe", "52": "lt only the great passionate pulse of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to c", "53": "heck what wisdom would be content to regulate. On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence from the A", "54": "ngel Clare of former times. It was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly his brothers. He ", "55": "was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his eyes looked", "56": " as much information as his tongue spoke, and more. The manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner of t", "57": "he drawingroom young man. A prig would have said that he had lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse. Such was the c", "58": "ontagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains. After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, nonev", "59": "angelical, welleducated, hallmarked young men, correct to their remotest fibre, such unimpeachable models as are turned out year", "60": "ly by the lathe of a systematic tuition. They were both somewhat shortsighted, and when it was the custom to wear a single eyegl", "61": "ass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass; w", "62": "hen it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway, all without reference to the particular variety of de", "63": "fect in their own vision. When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed ", "64": "him to grow dusty on their shelves. When Correggio\u2019s Holy Families were admired, they admired Correggio\u2019s Holy Families; when he"}, "77": {"1": " was decried in favour of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection. If these two noticed Angel\u2019s ", "2": "growing social ineptness, he noticed their growing mental limitations. Felix seemed to him all Church; Cuthbert all College. His", "3": " Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the mainsprings of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. Each brother candidly reco", "4": "gnized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were neither Universit", "5": "y men nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected. They were both dutiful and attentive", "6": " sons, and were regular in their visits to their parents. Felix, though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devoluti", "7": "on of theology than his father, was less selfsacrificing and disinterested. More tolerant than his father of a contradictory opi", "8": "nion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching. C", "9": "uthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberalminded, though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart. As they walked alo", "10": "ng the hillside Angel\u2019s former feeling revived in him\u2014that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself, neither saw or ", "11": "set forth life as it really was lived. Perhaps, as with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good as their o", "12": "pportunities of expression. Neither had an adequate conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle c", "13": "urrent in which they and their associates floated. Neither saw the difference between local truth and universal truth; that what", "14": " the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from what the outer world was thinking.", "15": " \u201cI suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,\u201d Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother", "16": ", as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity. \u201cAnd, therefore, we must make the best of it. Bu", "17": "t I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals. Farming, of course, means roughing it ex", "18": "ternally; but high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless.\u201d \u201cOf course it may,\u201d said Angel. \u201cWas it not proved nineteen", "19": " hundred years ago\u2014if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high th", "20": "inking and my moral ideals?\u201d \u201cWell, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our conversation\u2014it may be fancy only\u2014that you ", "21": "were somehow losing intellectual grasp. Hasn\u2019t it struck you, Cuthbert?\u201d \u201cNow, Felix,\u201d said Angel drily, \u201cwe are very good frien", "22": "ds, you know; each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogma", "23": "tist, had better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.\u201d They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed", "24": " at any time at which their father\u2019s and mother\u2019s morning work in the parish usually concluded. Convenience as regarded afternoo", "25": "n callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though the three sons were sufficien", "26": "tly in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions. The walk had made them hungry,", "27": " Angel in particular, who was now an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the dairyman\u2019s somewhat coarsely", "28": "laden table. But neither of the old people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their par", "29": "ents entered. The selfdenying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners, whom they, som", "30": "ewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh, their own appetites being quite forgotten. The family sat down to t", "31": "able, and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them. Angel looked round for Mrs Crick\u2019s blackpuddings, which he had", "32": " directed to be nicely grilled as they did them at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the mar", "33": "vellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself. \u201cAh! you are looking for the blackpuddings, my dear boy,\u201d observed Clare\u2019s m", "34": "other. \u201cBut I am sure you will not mind doing without them as I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason. I", "35": " suggested to him that we should take Mrs Crick\u2019s kind present to the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because ", "36": "of his attacks of delirium tremens; and he agreed that it would be a great pleasure to them; so we did.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said Angel", "37": " cheerfully, looking round for the mead. \u201cI found the mead so extremely alcoholic,\u201d continued his mother, \u201cthat it was quite unf", "38": "it for use as a beverage, but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my medicinecloset.\u201d \u201cWe never dr", "39": "ink spirits at this table, on principle,\u201d added his father. \u201cBut what shall I tell the dairyman\u2019s wife?\u201d said Angel. \u201cThe truth,", "40": " of course,\u201d said his father. \u201cI rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much. She is a kind, jolly ", "41": "sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.\u201d \u201cYou cannot, if we did not,\u201d Mr Clare answered lucidly. \u201cAh\u2014no; though t", "42": "hat mead was a drop of pretty tipple.\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d said Cuthbert and Felix both. \u201cOh\u2014\u2019tis an expression they use down at Talbothay", "43": "s,\u201d replied Angel, blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment, and said", "44": " no more. XXVI It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or", "45": " two subjects near his heart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet, studying", "46": " the little nails in the heels of their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother, an", "47": "d Mr Clare and himself were left alone. The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his positio", "48": "n as a farmer on an extensive scale\u2014either in England or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had not been put ", "49": "to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchas", "50": "e or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted. \u201cAs far as worldly wealth goes,\u201d continued ", "51": "his father, \u201cyou will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.\u201d This considerateness on old Mr Clare\u2019s part ", "52": "led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then sixandtwenty, and that when he shou", "53": "ld start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters\u2014some one would be necessary", "54": " to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marr", "55": "y?

The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but Mr Crick, as well as his wife, seemed ", "24": "latterly to have acquired a suspicion of mutual interest between these two; though they walked so circumspectly that suspicion w", "25": "as but of the faintest. Anyhow, the dairyman left them to themselves. They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting th", "26": "em into the vats. The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large scale; and amid the immaculate whiteness of the ", "27": "curds Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose. Angel, who was filling the vats with his handful, ", "28": "suddenly ceased, and laid his hands flat upon hers. Her sleeves were rolled far above the elbow, and bending lower he kissed the", "29": " inside vein of her soft arm. Although the early September weather was sultry, her arm, from her dabbling in the curds, was as c", "30": "old and damp to his mouth as a newgathered mushroom, and tasted of the whey. But she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that h", "31": "er pulse was accelerated by the touch, her blood driven to her fingerends, and the cool arms flushed hot. Then, as though her he", "32": "art had said, \u201cIs coyness longer necessary? Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and man,\u201d she lifted her eyes a", "33": "nd they beamed devotedly into his, as her lip rose in a tender halfsmile. \u201cDo you know why I did that, Tess?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause ", "34": "you love me very much!\u201d \u201cYes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.\u201d \u201cNot _again_!\u201d She looked a sudden fear that her resistan", "35": "ce might break down under her own desire. \u201cO, Tessy!\u201d he went on, \u201cI _cannot_ think why you are so tantalizing.

Clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after and caught her in the passage.", "42": " \u201cTell me, tell me!\u201d he said, passionately clasping her, in forgetfulness of his curdy hands: \u201cdo tell me that you won\u2019t belong ", "43": "to anybody but me!\u201d \u201cI will, I will tell you!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cAnd I will give you a complete answer, if you will let me go now.", "44": " I will tell you my experiences\u2014all about myself\u2014all!\u201d \u201cYour experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number.\u201d He expressed assent", "45": " in loving satire, looking into her face. \u201cMy Tess, no doubt, almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on t", "46": "he garden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time.

Here Tess flung herself down upon the rustling undergrowth of speargrass, as ", "50": "upon a bed, and remained crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy, which her fears about the ending cou", "51": "ld not altogether suppress. In reality, she was drifting into acquiescence. Every seesaw of her breath, every wave of her blood,", "52": " every pulse singing in her ears, was a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness. Reckless, inconsider", "53": "ate acceptance of him; to close with him at the altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe pleasure before", "54": " the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon her: that was what love counselled; and in almost a terror of ecstasy Tess ", "55": "divined that, despite her many months of lonely selfchastisement, wrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere is", "56": "olation, love\u2019s counsel would prevail. The afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows. She heard the rattle of", "57": " taking down the pails from the forked stands; the \u201cwaowwaow!\u201d which accompanied the getting together of the cows. But she did n", "58": "ot go to the milking. They would see her agitation; and the dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would goodnaturedly t", "59": "ease her; and that harassment could not be borne. Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some excuse fo", "60": "r her nonappearance, for no inquiries were made or calls given. At halfpast six the sun settled down upon the levels with the as", "61": "pect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous pumpkinlike moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows, t", "62": "ortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became spinyhaired monsters as they stood up against it. She went in ", "63": "and upstairs without a light. It was now Wednesday. Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance, but int", "64": "ruded in no way upon her. The indoor milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something definite was afoot, for they"}, "82": {"1": " did not force any remarks upon her in the bedchamber. Friday passed; Saturday.

Yet it is a wrong to him, ", "4": "and may kill him when he knows!

The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s consciousness, for it was the name of the lover who", "9": " had wronged his sweetheart, and had afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman\u2019s mother in the butterchurn. \u201cAnd had he", "10": " married the valiant matron\u2019s daughter, as he promised?\u201d asked Angel Clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was read", "11": "ing at the little table to which he was always banished by Mrs Crick, in her sense of his gentility. \u201cNot he, sir. Never meant t", "12": "o,\u201d replied the dairyman. \u201cAs I say, \u2019tis a widowwoman, and she had money, it seems\u2014fifty poun\u2019 a year or so; and that was all h", "13": "e was after.

She wanted a home, and didn\u2019t like to run the risk of losing him. Don\u2019t ye think that was something like it, maiden", "18": "s?\u201d He glanced towards the row of girls. \u201cShe ought to ha\u2019 told him just before they went to church, when he could hardly have b", "19": "acked out,\u201d exclaimed Marian. \u201cYes, she ought,\u201d agreed Izz. \u201cShe must have seen what he was after, and should ha\u2019 refused him,\u201d ", "20": "cried Retty spasmodically. \u201cAnd what do you say, my dear?\u201d asked the dairyman of Tess. \u201cI think she ought\u2014to have told him the t", "21": "rue state of things\u2014or else refused him\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Tess, the breadandbutter choking her. \u201cBe cust if I\u2019d have done e", "22": "ither o\u2019t,\u201d said Beck Knibbs, a married helper from one of the cottages. \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war.

Any woman could do it.\u201d The laught", "25": "er which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry smile, for form\u2019s sake, from Tess. What was comedy to them was tra", "26": "gedy to her; and she could hardly bear their mirth. She soon rose from table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon foll", "27": "ow her, went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she ", "28": "stood by the main stream of the Var. Men had been cutting the waterweeds higher up the river, and masses of them were floating p", "29": "ast her\u2014moving islands of green crowfoot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks of which weed had lodged against the ", "30": "piles driven to keep the cows from crossing. Yes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her story\u2014the heavi", "31": "est of crosses to herself\u2014seemed but amusement to others. It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom. \u201cTessy!\u201d came from behi", "32": "nd her, and Clare sprang across the gully, alighting beside her feet. \u201cMy wife\u2014soon!\u201d \u201cNo, no; I cannot. For your sake, O Mr Cla", "33": "re; for your sake, I say no!\u201d \u201cTess!\u201d \u201cStill I say no!\u201d she repeated. Not expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her w", "34": "aist the moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair. (The younger dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with thei", "35": "r hair loose on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending church, a style they could not adopt when milking", "36": " with their heads against the cows.) If she had said \u201cYes\u201d instead of \u201cNo\u201d he would have kissed her; it had evidently been his i", "37": "ntention; but her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart. Their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her, as the ", "38": "woman, to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment ", "39": "which he might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him. He released her momentarilyimprisoned waist, and wi", "40": "thheld the kiss. It all turned on that release. What had given her strength to refuse him this time was solely the tale of the w", "41": "idow told by the dairyman; and that would have been overcome in another moment. But Angel said no more; his face was perplexed; ", "42": "he went away. Day after day they met\u2014somewhat less constantly than before; and thus two or three weeks went by. The end of Septe", "43": "mber drew near, and she could see in his eye that he might ask her again. His plan of procedure was different now\u2014as though he h", "44": "ad made up his mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth startled by the novelty of the proposal. The fitf", "45": "ul evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea. So he played a more coaxing game; and ", "46": "while never going beyond words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost orally. In this way Clare persistently ", "47": "wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milk\u2014at the cow\u2019s side, at skimmings, at buttermakings, at cheesemakings, among", "48": " broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs\u2014as no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man. Tess knew that she must break down", "49": ". Neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold ou", "50": "t against it much longer. She loved him so passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though untrained, instinc", "51": "tively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, \u201cI can never be his", "52": " wife,\u201d the words were vain. A proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the tr", "53": "ouble to formulate. Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted t", "54": "he recantation she feared. His manner was\u2014what man\u2019s is not?\u2014so much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under", "55": " any conditions, changes, charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it. The season meanwhile was drawing", "56": " onward to the equinox, and though it was still fine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again worked by morning candleli", "57": "ght for a long time; and a fresh renewal of Clare\u2019s pleading occurred one morning between three and four. She had run up in her ", "58": "bedgown to his door to call him as usual; then had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes was walking to the", "59": " head of the stairs with the candle in her hand. At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirtsleeves and pu", "60": "t his arm across the stairway. \u201cNow, Miss Flirt, before you go down,\u201d he said peremptorily. \u201cIt is a fortnight since I spoke, an", "61": "d this won\u2019t do any longer. You _must_ tell me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar just now, an", "62": "d I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don\u2019t know. Well? Is it to be yes at last?\u201d \u201cI am only just up, Mr Clare, and it", "63": " is too early to take me to task!\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou need not call me Flirt. \u2019Tis cruel and untrue. Wait till by and by. Please w", "64": "ait till by and by! I will really think seriously about it between now and then. Let me go downstairs!\u201d She looked a little like"}, "83": {"1": " what he said she was as, holding the candle sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words. \u201cCall me Angel, the", "2": "n, and not Mr Clare.\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cAngel dearest\u2014why not?\u201d \u201c\u2019Twould mean that I agree, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt would only mean that you l", "3": "ove me, even if you cannot marry me; and you were so good as to own that long ago.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, \u2018Angel dearest\u2019, if I _mus", "4": "t_,\u201d she murmured, looking at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding her suspense. Clare had resolved", "5": " never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tuckedup milking gown, he", "6": "r hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke ", "7": "his resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment. She passed downstairs very quickly, never looking back at him or ", "8": "saying another word. The other maids were already down, and the subject was not pursued. Except Marian, they all looked wistfull", "9": "y and suspiciously at the pair, in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals", "10": " of the dawn without. When skimming was done\u2014which, as the milk diminished with the approach of autumn, was a lessening process ", "11": "day by day\u2014Retty and the rest went out. The lovers followed them. \u201cOur tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they no", "12": "t?\u201d he musingly observed to her, as he regarded the three figures tripping before him through the frigid pallor of opening day. ", "13": "\u201cNot so very different, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d \u201cThere are very few women\u2019s lives that are not\u2014tremulous,\u201d ", "14": "Tess replied, pausing over the new word as if it impressed her. \u201cThere\u2019s more in those three than you think.\u201d \u201cWhat is in them?\u201d", "15": " \u201cAlmost either of \u2019em,\u201d she began, \u201cwould make\u2014perhaps would make\u2014a properer wife than I. And perhaps they love you as well as ", "16": "I\u2014almost.\u201d \u201cO, Tessy!\u201d There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the impatient exclamation, though she had", "17": " resolved so intrepidly to let generosity make one bid against herself. That was now done, and she had not the power to attempt ", "18": "selfimmolation a second time then. They were joined by a milker from one of the cottages, and no more was said on that which con", "19": "cerned them so deeply. But Tess knew that this day would decide it. In the afternoon several of the dairyman\u2019s household and ass", "20": "istants went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where many of the cows were milked without being driven home", "21": ". The supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been d", "22": "ismissed. The work progressed leisurely. Each pailful was poured into tall cans that stood in a large springwaggon which had bee", "23": "n brought upon the scene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away. Dairyman Crick, who was there with the rest, his wra", "24": "pper gleaming miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked at his heavy watch. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis later than I thoug", "25": "ht,\u201d he said. \u201cBegad! We shan\u2019t be soon enough with this milk at the station, if we don\u2019t mind. There\u2019s no time today to take it", "26": " home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off. It must go to station straight from here. Who\u2019ll drive it across?\u201d Mr Clare vo", "27": "lunteered to do so, though it was none of his business, asking Tess to accompany him. The evening, though sunless, had been warm", "28": " and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with her milkinghood only, nakedarmed and jacketless; certainly not dressed for", "29": " a drive. She therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments; but Clare gently urged her. She assented by relinquishin", "30": "g her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and mounted the springwaggon beside Clare. XXX In the diminishing daylight th", "31": "ey went along the level roadway through the meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and were backed in the extreme edge of ", "32": "distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of Egdon Heath. On its summit stood clumps and stretches of firtrees, whose notched ti", "33": "ps appeared like battlemented towers crowning blackfronted castles of enchantment. They were so absorbed in the sense of being c", "34": "lose to each other that they did not begin talking for a long while, the silence being broken only by the clucking of the milk i", "35": "n the tall cans behind them. The lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the boughs till they sli", "36": "pped from their shells, and the blackberries hung in heavy clusters.

One of them had stared her up and down ", "16": "in surprise, and she fancied he was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many miles off that Trantridge folk were rariti", "17": "es here. \u201cA comely maid that,\u201d said the other. \u201cTrue, comely enough. But unless I make a great mistake\u2014\u201d And he negatived the re", "18": "mainder of the definition forthwith. Clare had just returned from the stableyard, and, confronting the man on the threshold, hea", "19": "rd the words, and saw the shrinking of Tess. The insult to her stung him to the quick, and before he had considered anything at ", "20": "all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist, sending him staggering backwards into the passage. The man re", "21": "covered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare, stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. But ", "22": "his opponent began to think better of the matter. He looked anew at Tess as he passed her, and said to Clare\u2014 \u201cI beg pardon, sir", "23": "; \u2019twas a complete mistake. I thought she was another woman, forty miles from here.\u201d Clare, feeling then that he had been too ha", "24": "sty, and that he was, moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an innpassage, did what he usually did in such cases, gave ", "25": "the man five shillings to plaster the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific good night. As soon as Clare had ", "26": "taken the reins from the ostler, and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other direction. \u201cAnd was it a mis", "27": "take?\u201d said the second one. \u201cNot a bit of it. But I didn\u2019t want to hurt the gentleman\u2019s feelings\u2014not I.\u201d In the meantime the lov", "28": "ers were driving onward. \u201cCould we put off our wedding till a little later?\u201d Tess asked in a dry dull voice. \u201cI mean if we wishe", "29": "d?\u201d \u201cNo, my love. Calm yourself. Do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault?\u201d he asked goodhumouredly. \u201c", "30": "No\u2014I only meant\u2014if it should have to be put off.\u201d What she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss such fancies", "31": " from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she could.

Tess sat up gett", "34": "ing on with some little requisites, lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time. While she sat she heard a noi", "35": "se in Angel\u2019s room overhead, a sound of thumping and struggling. Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her anxiety lest", "36": " Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door, and asked him what was the matter. \u201cOh, nothing, dear,\u201d he said from wi", "37": "thin. \u201cI am so sorry I disturbed you!

I am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep. Go to bed and think of it no more.\u201d This was the las", "40": "t drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision.

She sat down and wrote on the four pages of a notesheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ag", "42": "o, put it into an envelope, and directed it to Clare. Then, lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any ", "43": "shoes and slipped the note under his door. Her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for the first faint", "44": " noise overhead. It came, as usual; he descended, as usual. She descended. He met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her", "45": ". Surely it was as warmly as ever! He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a word to her about her r", "46": "evelation, even when they were alone. Could he have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing. So ", "47": "the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as be", "48": "fore. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and s", "49": "miled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note? She glanced into his room, and could see nothi", "50": "ng of it. It might be that he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely", "51": " would forgive her. Every morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year\u2019s Eve broke\u2014the wedding day. The lovers did not r", "52": "ise at milkingtime, having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the posi", "53": "tion of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own.

This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which h", "3": "e meant to surprise them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d\u2019Urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temera", "4": "rious and risky; hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways by a few months\u2019 travel an", "5": "d reading with him, he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as wor", "6": "thy of such an ancient line. It was a pretty lover\u2019s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess\u2019s lineage had more value for himself than f", "7": "or anybody in the world beside. Her perception that Angel\u2019s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own com", "8": "munication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it. She rose from breakfast before he had finished, and has", "9": "tened upstairs. It had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare\u2019s den, or rather eyrie, ", "10": "for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment, regarding and pondering. She stooped to the th", "11": "reshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close ", "12": "to the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him,", "13": " which he obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door.

The only minute Tess could get to be alo", "20": "ne with Clare was when they met upon the landing. \u201cI am so anxious to talk to you\u2014I want to confess all my faults and blunders!\u201d", "21": " she said with attempted lightness. \u201cNo, no\u2014we can\u2019t have faults talked of\u2014you must be deemed perfect today at least, my Sweet!\u201d", "22": " he cried. \u201cWe shall have plenty of time, hereafter, I hope, to talk over our failings.

If he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her trust in h", "7": "is protectiveness. Clare came close, and bent over her. \u201cDead, dead, dead!\u201d he murmured. After fixedly regarding her for some mo", "8": "ments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled her in the sheet as in a shrou", "9": "d. Then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her across the room, murmurin", "10": "g\u2014 \u201cMy poor, poor Tess\u2014my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so true!\u201d The words of endearment, withheld so severely in h", "11": "is waking hours, were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If it had been to save her weary life she would not, ", "12": "by moving or struggling, have put an end to the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute stillness, scarcely vent", "13": "uring to breathe, and, wondering what he was going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing. \u201cMy wife\u2014d", "14": "ead, dead!\u201d he said. He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister. Was he going to throw her down", "15": "? Selfsolicitude was near extinction in her, and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow, possibly for alwa", "16": "ys, she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. If they could only fall togeth", "17": "er, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit, how desirable. However, he did not let her fall, but took advantage of the support of", "18": " the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips\u2014lips in the daytime scorned. Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, ", "19": "and descended the staircase. The creak of the loose stair did not awaken him, and they reached the groundfloor safely. Freeing o", "20": "ne of his hands from his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the doorbar and passed out, slightly striking his stockinged to", "21": "e against the edge of the door. But this he seemed not to mind, and, having room for extension in the open air, he lifted her ag", "22": "ainst his shoulder, so that he could carry her with ease, the absence of clothes taking much from his burden. Thus he bore her o", "23": "ff the premises in the direction of the river a few yards distant. His ultimate intention, if he had any, she had not yet divine", "24": "d; and she found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have done.

Ah! ", "28": "now she knew what he was dreaming of\u2014that Sunday morning when he had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids", "29": ", who had loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which Tess could hardly admit. Clare did not cross the bridge ", "30": "with her, but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill, at length stood still on the brink of the ri", "31": "ver. Its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently divided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping the", "32": "mselves around little islands that had no name, returning and reembodying themselves as a broad main stream further on. Opposite", "33": " the spot to which he had brought her was such a general confluence, and the river was proportionately voluminous and deep. Acro", "34": "ss it was a narrow footbridge; but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away, leaving the bare plank only, which, lying ", "35": "a few inches above the speeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and Tess had noticed from the window of t", "36": "he house in the daytime young men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing. Her husband had possibly observed the same perf", "37": "ormance; anyhow, he now mounted the plank, and, sliding one foot forward, advanced along it. Was he going to drown her? Probably", "38": " he was. The spot was lonely, the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of accomplishment. He might drown her i", "39": "f he would; it would be better than parting tomorrow to lead severed lives. The swift stream raced and gyrated under them, tossi", "40": "ng, distorting, and splitting the moon\u2019s reflected face. Spots of froth travelled past, and intercepted weeds waved behind the p", "41": "iles. If they could both fall together into the current now, their arms would be so tightly clasped together that they could not", "42": " be saved; they would go out of the world almost painlessly, and there would be no more reproach to her, or to him for marrying ", "43": "her. His last halfhour with her would have been a loving one, while if they lived till he awoke, his daytime aversion would retu", "44": "rn, and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a transient dream. The impulse stirred in her, yet she dared not indul", "45": "ge it, to make a movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf. How she valued her own life had been proved; but", "46": " his\u2014she had no right to tamper with it. He reached the other side with her in safety. Here they were within a plantation which ", "47": "formed the Abbey grounds, and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached the ruined choir of the Abbe", "48": "ychurch. Against the north wall was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with a turn for grim humour was a", "49": "ccustomed to stretch himself. In this Clare carefully laid Tess. Having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply, as if ", "50": "a greatly desired end were attained. Clare then lay down on the ground alongside, when he immediately fell into the deep dead sl", "51": "umber of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a log. The spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort was now over", "52": ". Tess sat up in the coffin. The night, though dry and mild for the season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous", "53": " for him to remain here long, in his halfclothed state. If he were left to himself he would in all probability stay there till t", "54": "he morning, and be chilled to certain death. She had heard of such deaths after sleepwalking. But how could she dare to awaken h", "55": "im, and let him know what he had been doing, when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of her? Tess, however, s", "56": "tepping out of her stone confine, shook him slightly, but was unable to arouse him without being violent. It was indispensable t", "57": "o do something, for she was beginning to shiver, the sheet being but a poor protection. Her excitement had in a measure kept her", "58": " warm during the few minutes\u2019 adventure; but that beatific interval was over. It suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion; and", "59": " accordingly she whispered in his ear, with as much firmness and decision as she could summon\u2014 \u201cLet us walk on, darling,\u201d at the", "60": " same time taking him suggestively by the arm. To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced; her words had apparently thrown him b", "61": "ack into his dream, which thenceforward seemed to enter on a new phase, wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit, and was le", "62": "ading him to Heaven. Thus she conducted him by the arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which they stoo", "63": "d at the manorhouse door. Tess\u2019s feet were quite bare, and the stones hurt her, and chilled her to the bone; but Clare was in hi", "64": "s woollen stockings and appeared to feel no discomfort. There was no further difficulty. She induced him to lie down on his own "}, "100": {"1": "sofa bed, and covered him up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of wood, to dry any dampness out of him. The noise of these atten", "2": "tions she thought might awaken him, and secretly wished that they might. But the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that h", "3": "e remained undisturbed. As soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew little or nothing of how far she had b", "4": "een concerned in the night\u2019s excursion, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that he had not lain still. In truth", "5": ", he had awakened that morning from a sleep deep as annihilation; and during those first few moments in which the brain, like a ", "6": "Samson shaking himself, is trying its strength, he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding. But the realities of ", "7": "his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject. He waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing; he knew t", "8": "hat if any intention of his, concluded overnight, did not vanish in the light of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to o", "9": "ne of pure reason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so far, therefore, to be trusted. He thus beheld in the ", "10": "pale morning light the resolve to separate from her; not as a hot and indignant instinct, but denuded of the passionateness whic", "11": "h had made it scorch and burn; standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the less there. Clare no longer hesitated", "12": ". At breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles, he showed his weariness from the night\u2019s effort so unmis", "13": "takeably that Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, ", "14": "stultify him, to know that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his commonsense did not approve, that his", "15": " inclination had compromised his dignity when reason slept, again deterred her. It was too much like laughing at a man when sobe", "16": "r for his erratic deeds during intoxication. It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection of his tende", "17": "r vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave", "18": " her of appealing to him anew not to go. He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and soon after breakfast it a", "19": "rrived. She saw in it the beginning of the end\u2014the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident", "20": " of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The luggage was put on the top, and the man drove them off, the mille", "21": "r and the old waitingwoman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to his discovery that", "22": " the millwork was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went. Beyond thi", "23": "s there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not going together to visit friends.", "24": " Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wis", "25": "hed to wind up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick a call at the same time, unless she would ex", "26": "cite suspicion of their unhappy state. To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by the wicket leading", "27": " down from the high road to the dairyhouse, and descended the track on foot, side by side. The withybed had been cut, and they c", "28": "ould see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure ", "29": "in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the cowstalls the mead which had been the scene of their first", "30": " embrace. The gold of the summer picture was now gray, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold. Over the bartong", "31": "ate the dairyman saw them, and came forward, throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in Talbothays and ", "32": "its vicinity on the reappearance of the newlymarried. Then Mrs Crick emerged from the house, and several others of their old acq", "33": "uaintance, though Marian and Retty did not seem to be there. Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which a", "34": "ffected her far otherwise than they supposed. In the tacit agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret the", "35": "y behaved as would have been ordinary. And then, although she would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject, Tess ha", "36": "d to hear in detail the story of Marian and Retty. The later had gone home to her father\u2019s, and Marian had left to look for empl", "37": "oyment elsewhere. They feared she would come to no good. To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her fav", "38": "ourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her hand, and as she and Clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body ", "39": "and soul, there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one who should have seen it truly; two limbs of on", "40": "e life, as they outwardly were, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching him, facing one way, as against all the dairy facing ", "41": "the other, speaking in their adieux as \u201cwe\u201d, and yet sundered like the poles. Perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed ", "42": "in their attitude, some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity, different from the natural shyness of young coupl", "43": "es, may have been apparent, for when they were gone Mrs Crick said to her husband\u2014 \u201cHow onnatural the brightness of her eyes did", "44": " seem, and how they stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream! Didn\u2019t it strike \u2019ee that \u2019twas so? Tess had ", "45": "always sommat strange in her, and she\u2019s not now quite like the proud young bride of a wellbedoing man.\u201d They reentered the vehic", "46": "le, and were driven along the roads towards Weatherbury and Stagfoot Lane, till they reached the Lane inn, where Clare dismissed", "47": " the fly and man. They rested here a while, and entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did", "48": " not know their relations. At a midway point, when Nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were crossroads, Clare stopped th", "49": "e conveyance and said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother\u2019s house it was here that he would leave her. As they cou", "50": "ld not talk with freedom in the driver\u2019s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch ", "51": "roads; she assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away. \u201cNow, let us understand each other,\u201d he sai", "52": "d gently. \u201cThere is no anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present.

But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me.\u201d The severity of the", "55": " decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of one wh", "56": "o had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could con", "57": "test the point with him no further.

XXXIX It was three weeks af", "25": "ter the marriage that Clare found himself descending the hill which led to the wellknown parsonage of his father. With his downw", "26": "ard course the tower of the church rose into the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and no living person ", "27": "in the twilighted town seemed to notice him, still less to expect him. He was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his own fo", "28": "otsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of. The picture of life had changed for him. Before this time he had known it bu", "29": "t speculatively; now he thought he knew it as a practical man; though perhaps he did not, even yet. Nevertheless humanity stood ", "30": "before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art, but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and w", "31": "ith the leer of a study by Van Beers. His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond description. After mechanic", "32": "ally attempting to pursue his agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened, in the manner recommended by the great ", "33": "and wise men of all ages, he concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to t", "34": "est the feasibility of their counsel. \u201cThis is the chief thing: be not perturbed,\u201d said the Pagan moralist. That was just Clare\u2019", "35": "s own opinion. But he was perturbed. \u201cLet not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,\u201d said the Nazarene. Clare chimed", "36": " in cordially; but his heart was troubled all the same. How he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers, and earnes", "37": "tly appeal to them as fellowman to fellowmen, and ask them to tell him their method! His mood transmuted itself into a dogged in", "38": "difference till at length he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest of an outsider. He was embitt", "39": "ered by the conviction that all this desolation had been brought about by the accident of her being a d\u2019Urberville. When he foun", "40": "d that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of the new tribes from below, as he had fondly dreamed, why had he ", "41": "not stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles? This was what he had got by apostasy, and his punishment was deserved", "42": ". Then he became weary and anxious, and his anxiety increased. He wondered if he had treated her unfairly. He ate without knowin", "43": "g that he ate, and drank without tasting. As the hours dropped past, as the motive of each act in the long series of bygone days", "44": " presented itself to his view, he perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as a dear possession was mixed up with all ", "45": "his schemes and words and ways. In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small town a redandblue placard se", "46": "tting forth the great advantages of the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist. Land was offered there on ", "47": "exceptionally advantageous terms. Brazil somewhat attracted him as a new idea. Tess could eventually join him there, and perhaps", "48": " in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her", "49": " seem impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was", "50": " just at hand. With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents, and to make the best explanatio", "51": "n he could make of arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As he reached the door the new mo", "52": "on shone upon his face, just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms", "53": " across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but his face was thinner now. Clare had given his parents no warning of his vis", "54": "it, and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool.

She will remain at her mother\u2019s till I", "7": " come back.\u201d \u201cAnd I shall not see her before you start?\u201d He was afraid they would not. His original plan had been, as he had sai", "8": "d, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while\u2014not to wound their prejudices\u2014feelings\u2014in any way; and for other rea", "9": "sons he had adhered to it.

That evening he was within a featherweight\u2019s turn of abandoning his road to the ", "30": "nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line of South Wessex which divided him from his Tess\u2019s home. It was nei", "31": "ther a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her heart, which deterred him. No; it was a sense that, despite her lo", "32": "ve, as corroborated by Izz\u2019s admission, the facts had not changed. If he was right at first, he was right now. And the momentum ", "33": "of the course on which he had embarked tended to keep him going in it, unless diverted by a stronger, more sustained force than ", "34": "had played upon him this afternoon. He could soon come back to her. He took the train that night for London, and five days after", "35": " shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of embarkation. XLI From the foregoing events of the wintertime let us pres", "36": "s on to an October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting of Clare and Tess. We discover the latter in changed co", "37": "nditions; instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in he", "38": "r own porterage, as at an earlier time when she was no bride; instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for ", "39": "her comfort through this probationary period, she can produce only a flattened purse. After again leaving Marlott, her home, she", "40": " had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time being mainly spent in renderi", "41": "ng light irregular service at dairywork near PortBredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote from her native place", "42": " and from Talbothays. She preferred this to living on his allowance. Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a condition whic", "43": "h the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked. Her consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in th", "44": "e presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there\u2014he who, the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disa", "45": "ppeared like a shape in a vision. The dairywork lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had not met with a second reg", "46": "ular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done duty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now beginning, she had simp", "47": "ly to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done. Of ", "48": "the fiveandtwenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare\u2019s allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contri", "49": "bution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them, she had as yet spent but little. But there now foll", "50": "owed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns. She could not bear t", "51": "o let them go. Angel had put them into her hand, had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had consecrat", "52": "ed them to souvenirs of himself\u2014they appeared to have had as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own ex", "53": "periences\u2014and to disperse them was like giving away relics. But she had to do it, and one by one they left her hands. She had be", "54": "en compelled to send her mother her address from time to time, but she concealed her circumstances. When her money had almost go", "55": "ne a letter from her mother reached her. Joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through th", "56": "e thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been p", "57": "aid for. New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which, with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twen", "58": "ty pounds. As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money? Tess h", "59": "ad thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel\u2019s bankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum wa", "60": "s received she sent the twenty as requested. Part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a ", "61": "nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound had gone, a remark of Angel\u2019s that whenever she required", "62": " further resources she was to apply to his father, remained to be considered. But the more Tess thought of the step, the more re", "63": "luctant was she to take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be called, on Clare\u2019s account, which had led ", "64": "her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the"}, "106": {"1": " fair allowance he had left her. They probably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in the character of a ", "2": "mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort could the parson\u2019s daughterinlaw bring herself to let him know her state. Her r", "3": "eluctance to communicate with her husband\u2019s parents might, she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reve", "4": "rse obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that sh", "5": "e was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that ", "6": "she was awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after ", "7": "which he would come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon present a united ", "8": "front to their families and the world. This hope she still fostered. To let her parents know that she was a deserted wife, depen", "9": "dent, now that she had relieved their necessities, on her own hands for a living, after the _\u00e9clat_ of a marriage which was to n", "10": "ullify the collapse of the first attempt, would be too much indeed. The set of brilliants returned to her mind. Where Clare had ", "11": "deposited them she did not know, and it mattered little, if it were true that she could only use and not sell them. Even were th", "12": "ey absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which was not essentially hers at all.

To ", "18": "return. Thus it happened that when the last of Tess\u2019s sovereigns had been spent she was unprovided with others to take their pla", "19": "ce, while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get employment. Not being aware of the rarity of intel", "20": "ligence, energy, health, and willingness in any sphere of life, she refrained from seeking an indoor occupation; fearing towns, ", "21": "large houses, people of means and social sophistication, and of manners other than rural. From that direction of gentility Black", "22": " Care had come. Society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience of it.

Room would probably have been made for her a", "25": "t Talbothays, if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as her life had been there, she could not go back. The anticlimax", "26": " would be too intolerable; and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized husband. She could not have borne their pity, a", "27": "nd their whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation; though she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circ", "28": "umstances by every individual there, so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each. It was the interchange of i", "29": "deas about her that made her sensitiveness wince. Tess could not account for this distinction; she simply knew that she felt it.", "30": " She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county, to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter w", "31": "hich had reached her from Marian. Marian had somehow heard that Tess was separated from her husband\u2014probably through Izz Huett\u2014a", "32": "nd the goodnatured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself ", "33": "had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her there, where there was room for other hands, if ", "34": "it was really true that she worked again as of old. With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband\u2019s forgiven", "35": "ess began to leave her; and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she r", "36": "ambled on\u2014disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to", "37": " accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness, ", "38": "if not to theirs. Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the attention she excited by her appearance, a", "39": " certain bearing of distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her natural attractiveness. Whilst the clo", "40": "thes lasted which had been prepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused her no inconvenience, but as soon ", "41": "as she was compelled to don the wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than once; but nothing occurred t", "42": "o cause her bodily fear till a particular November afternoon. She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland", "43": " farm for which she was now bound, because, for one thing, it was nearer to the home of her husband\u2019s father; and to hover about", "44": " that region unrecognized, with the notion that she might decide to call at the Vicarage some day, gave her pleasure. But having", "45": " once decided to try the higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward, marching afoot towards the village of ChalkNewton, ", "46": "where she meant to pass the night.

Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world\u2019s active hours had grown strong, she crept from under ", "10": "her hillock of leaves, and looked around boldly.

The plantation wherei", "11": "n she had taken shelter ran down at this spot into a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the hedge being arable ground.

As soon as ", "38": "she got out of the village she entered a thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest fieldgowns, which she had never put ", "39": "on even at the dairy\u2014never since she had worked among the stubble at Marlott. She also, by a felicitous thought, took a handkerc", "40": "hief from her bundle and tied it round her face under her bonnet, covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples, as if she w", "41": "ere suffering from toothache. Then with her little scissors, by the aid of a pocket lookingglass, she mercilessly nipped her eye", "42": "brows off, and thus insured against aggressive admiration, she went on her uneven way. \u201cWhat a mommet of a maid!\u201d said the next ", "43": "man who met her to a companion.

Her object being a winter\u2019s occupation and a winter\u2019s home, there was no time to lose. Her exper", "54": "ience of short hirings had been such that she was determined to accept no more.

There seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doom", "5": "ed to come. The stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; ", "6": "but it was time to rest from searching, and she resolved to stay, particularly as it began to rain. At the entrance to the villa", "7": "ge was a cottage whose gable jutted into the road, and before applying for a lodging she stood under its shelter, and watched th", "8": "e evening close in. \u201cWho would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!\u201d she said. The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she fou", "9": "nd that immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of which came through the bricks. She warmed her hands ", "10": "upon them, and also put her cheek\u2014red and moist with the drizzle\u2014against their comforting surface. The wall seemed to be the onl", "11": "y friend she had.

But in the villagestreet she had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one femin", "14": "ine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown and the tiltbonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought ", "15": "it might be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even ", "16": "stouter and redder in the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her existence Tess wou", "17": "ld hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded readily t", "18": "o Marian\u2019s greeting.

Fema", "44": "le fieldlabour was seldom offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women could perform as readily as me", "45": "n. Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the", "46": " house at whose gablewall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she had ensured, but it would afford a shelter ", "47": "for the winter at any rate. That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case a letter should arrive at Mar", "48": "lott from her husband. But she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought reproach upon him. XLI", "49": "II There was no exaggeration in Marian\u2019s definition of FlintcombAsh farm as a starveacre place. The single fat thing on the soil", "50": " was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village", "51": " cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squ", "52": "ire\u2019s tenantry, the village of free or copyholders, and the absenteeowner\u2019s village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb", "53": "Ash, was the third. But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a m", "54": "inor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swedefield in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stre", "55": "tch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop ", "56": "of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The", "57": " upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the livestock, and it was the business of the two women to grub up the lower or", "58": " earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also. Every leaf of the vegetable having alr", "59": "eady been consumed, the whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin", "60": " to brow, should be only an expanse of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white vacuity of countenance ", "61": "with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face looking down ", "62": "on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls cra", "63": "wling over the surface of the former like flies. Nobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical regularity; thei", "64": "r forms standing enshrouded in Hessian \u201cwroppers\u201d\u2014sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep their gowns from b"}, "109": {"1": "lowing about\u2014scant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets. The pensi", "2": "ve character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception", "3": " of the two Marys. They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect they bore in the landscape, not thinking of", "4": " the justice or injustice of their lot. Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream. In the afternoon ", "5": "the rain came on again, and Marian said that they need not work any more. But if they did not work they would not be paid; so th", "6": "ey worked on. It was so high a situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally upon t", "7": "he yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through. Tess had not known till now what was really", "8": " meant by that. There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common talk. But to stand workin", "9": "g slowly in a field, and feel the creep of rainwater, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then at back, front, a", "10": "nd sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum of stoi", "11": "cism, even of valour. Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They were both young, and they were talkin", "12": "g of the time when they lived and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land where summer had been liber", "13": "al in her gifts; in substance to all, emotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was le", "14": "gally, if not actually, her husband; but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian\u2019s re", "15": "marks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrapper", "16": "s clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays. \u201cYou can se", "17": "e a gleam of a hill within a few miles o\u2019 Froom Valley from here when \u2019tis fine,\u201d said Marian. \u201cAh! Can you?\u201d said Tess, awake t", "18": "o the new value of this locality. So the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will to enjoy, and the circums", "19": "tantial will against enjoyment. Marian\u2019s will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore o", "20": "n a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which she invited Tess to drink. Tess\u2019s unassisted power of dreaming, however, being", "21": " enough for her sublimation at present, she declined except the merest sip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits. \u201cI\u2019ve ", "22": "got used to it,\u201d she said, \u201cand can\u2019t leave it off now. \u2019Tis my only comfort\u2014You see I lost him: you didn\u2019t; and you can do with", "23": "out it perhaps.\u201d Tess thought her loss as great as Marian\u2019s, but upheld by the dignity of being Angel\u2019s wife, in the letter at l", "24": "east, she accepted Marian\u2019s differentiation. Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon rains. When ", "25": "it was not swedegrubbing it was swedetrimming, in which process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a billhook before ", "26": "storing the roots for future use. At this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained; but if it ", "27": "was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers. Still Tes", "28": "s hoped. She had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Cla", "29": "re\u2019s character would lead him to rejoin her. Marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queershaped flints aforesaid,", "30": " and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely obtuse. They often looked across the country to where the Var or Froom was kn", "31": "own to stretch, even though they might not be able to see it; and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the old", "32": " times they had spent out there. \u201cAh,\u201d said Marian, \u201chow I should like another or two of our old set to come here! Then we could", "33": " bring up Talbothays every day here afield, and talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o\u2019 the old things we used t", "34": "o know, and make it all come back a\u2019most, in seeming!\u201d Marian\u2019s eyes softened, and her voice grew vague as the visions returned.", "35": " \u201cI\u2019ll write to Izz Huett,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s biding at home doing nothing now, I know, and I\u2019ll tell her we be here, and ask her", "36": " to come; and perhaps Retty is well enough now.\u201d Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard of this pl", "37": "an for importing old Talbothays\u2019 joys was two or three days later, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry,", "38": " and had promised to come if she could. There had not been such a winter for years. It came on in stealthy and measured glides, ", "39": "like the moves of a chessplayer. One morning the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had put of", "40": "f a vegetable for an animal integument. Every twig was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night, ", "41": "giving it four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of", "42": " the sky and horizon. Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into", "43": " visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of white worsted from salient points of the outhouses, posts, an", "44": "d gates. After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost, when strange birds from behind the North Pole began ", "45": "to arrive silently on the upland of FlintcombAsh; gaunt spectral creatures with tragical eyes\u2014eyes which had witnessed scenes of", "46": " cataclysmal horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had ever conceived, in curdling temperat", "47": "ures that no man could endure; which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snowhills by the shooting light of the Au", "48": "rora; been half blinded by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and retained the expression of feature that", "49": " such scenes had engendered. These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of all they had seen which humanity wo", "50": "uld never see, they brought no account.

Then one", "53": " day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country. There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was ", "54": "not of frost. It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows ache, penetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface ", "55": "of the body less than its core. They knew that it meant snow, and in the night the snow came. Tess, who continued to live at the", "56": " cottage with the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it, awoke in the night, and heard above the th", "57": "atch noises which seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds. When she lit her lamp to ", "58": "get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement, forming a white cone of the finest powd", "59": "er against the inside, and had also come down the chimney, so that it lay soledeep upon the floor, on which her shoes left track", "60": "s when she moved about.

Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by the time she had finished breakfast be", "62": "side the solitary little lamp, Marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reeddrawing in the bar", "63": "n till the weather changed. As soon, therefore, as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of", "64": " grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats round their necks an"}, "110": {"1": "d across their chests, and started for the barn. The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a clo", "2": "ud, and individual flakes could not be seen. The blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears, carrying the sno", "3": "w so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it.

The air, afflicted to", "5": " pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it, twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an achromatic chaos of thing", "6": "s. But both the young women were fairly cheerful; such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting. \u201cHaha! the cunning ", "7": "northern birds knew this was coming,\u201d said Marian. \u201cDepend upon\u2019t, they keep just in front o\u2019t all the way from the North Star.

One end of the long structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reeddrawing was carried on,", "16": " and there had already been placed in the reedpress the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the w", "17": "omen to draw from during the day. \u201cWhy, here\u2019s Izz!\u201d said Marian. Izz it was, and she came forward. She had walked all the way f", "18": "rom her mother\u2019s home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the distance so great, had been belated, arriving, however, ju", "19": "st before the snow began, and sleeping at the alehouse. The farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she ca", "20": "me today, and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay. In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a ", "21": "neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior,", "22": " the Queen of Diamonds\u2014those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at Trantridge. They showed no recognition o", "23": "f her, and possibly had none, for they had been under the influence of liquor on that occasion, and were only temporary sojourne", "24": "rs there as here. They did all kinds of men\u2019s work by preference, including wellsinking, hedging, ditching, and excavating, with", "25": "out any sense of fatigue. Noted reeddrawers were they too, and looked round upon the other three with some superciliousness. Put", "26": "ting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the press, an erection formed of two posts connected by a crossbeam, ", "27": "under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered", "28": " as the sheaves diminished. The day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors upwards from the snow instead of do", "29": "wnwards from the sky. The girls pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the presence of the strange women,", "30": " who were recounting scandals, Marian and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do. Presently they heard th", "31": "e muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer rode up to the barndoor. When he had dismounted he came close to Tess, and remained l", "32": "ooking musingly at the side of her face. She had not turned at first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round, when she per", "33": "ceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the highroad because of his allusion to ", "34": "her history. He waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside, when he said, \u201cSo you be the young woman who ", "35": "took my civility in such ill part? Be drowned if I didn\u2019t think you might be as soon as I heard of your being hired! Well, you t", "36": "hought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancyman, and the second time on the road, when you bolt", "37": "ed; but now I think I\u2019ve got the better of you.\u201d He concluded with a hard laugh. Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like ", "38": "a bird caught in a clapnet, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw. She could read character sufficiently well to know", "39": " by this time that she had nothing to fear from her employer\u2019s gallantry; it was rather the tyranny induced by his mortification", "40": " at Clare\u2019s treatment of him. Upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to endure it. \u201cYou though", "41": "t I was in love with \u2019ee I suppose? Some women are such fools, to take every look as serious earnest. But there\u2019s nothing like a", "42": " winter afield for taking that nonsense out o\u2019 young wenches\u2019 heads; and you\u2019ve signed and agreed till LadyDay. Now, are you goi", "43": "ng to beg my pardon?\u201d \u201cI think you ought to beg mine.\u201d \u201cVery well\u2014as you like. But we\u2019ll see which is master here. Be they all t", "44": "he sheaves you\u2019ve done today?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis a very poor show.

When two o\u2019clock arrived t", "49": "he professional reeddrawers tossed off the last halfpint in their flagon, put down their hooks, tied their last sheaves, and wen", "50": "t away. Marian and Izz would have done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer hours for her lack", "51": " of skill, they would not leave her. Looking out at the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got it all to ours", "52": "elves.\u201d And so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the incidents of their aff", "53": "ection for Angel Clare. \u201cIzz and Marian,\u201d said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was extremely touching, seeing how very lit", "54": "tle of a wife she was: \u201cI can\u2019t join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you will see that I cannot; because,", "55": " although he is gone away from me for the present, he is my husband.\u201d Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the", "56": " four girls who had loved Clare. \u201cHe was a very splendid lover, no doubt,\u201d she said; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he is a too fond husband", "57": " to go away from you so soon.\u201d \u201cHe had to go\u2014he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!\u201d pleaded Tess. \u201cHe might ha", "58": "ve tided \u2019ee over the winter.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s owing to an accident\u2014a misunderstanding; and we won\u2019t argue it,\u201d Tess answered, with t", "59": "earfulness in her words. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a good deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands, without tellin", "60": "g me; and I can always find out where he is.\u201d After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went on seizing", "61": " the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their billhooks, nothing ", "62": "sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the h", "63": "eap of wheatears at her feet. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it!\u201d cried Marian. \u201cIt wants harder flesh than yours for thi", "64": "s work.\u201d Just then the farmer entered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s how you get on when I am away,\u201d he said to her. \u201cBut it is my own loss,\u201d she "}, "111": {"1": "pleaded. \u201cNot yours.\u201d \u201cI want it finished,\u201d he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2019ee ", "2": "mind him, there\u2019s a dear,\u201d said Marian. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here before.

I\u2019m taller than you, too.\u201d However, she was so overcome that she consented to lie do", "4": "wn awhile, and reclined on a heap of pulltails\u2014the refuse after the straight straw had been drawn\u2014thrown up at the further side ", "5": "of the barn. Her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the reopening the subject of her separation from her husb", "6": "and as to the hard work. She lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ", "7": "ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches. She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the murmur of ", "8": "their voices. She felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached, but their voices were so low that she cou", "9": "ld not catch the words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying, and, persuading herself that she ", "10": "felt better, she got up and resumed work. Then Izz Huett broke down. She had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening", "11": ", had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen again at five o\u2019clock. Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutne", "12": "ss of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she felt better, t", "13": "o finish the day without her, and make equal division of the number of sheaves. Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappear", "14": "ed through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging. Marian, as was the case every afternoon at this time on account o", "15": "f the bottle, began to feel in a romantic vein. \u201cI should not have thought it of him\u2014never!\u201d she said in a dreamy tone. \u201cAnd I l", "16": "oved him so! I didn\u2019t mind his having _you_. But this about Izz is too bad!\u201d Tess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed cu", "17": "tting off a finger with the billhook. \u201cIs it about my husband?\u201d she stammered. \u201cWell, yes. Izz said, \u2018Don\u2019t \u2019ee tell her\u2019; but I", "18": " am sure I can\u2019t help it! It was what he wanted Izz to do. He wanted her to go off to Brazil with him.\u201d Tess\u2019s face faded as whi", "19": "te as the scene without, and its curves straightened. \u201cAnd did Izz refuse to go?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyhow he changed hi", "20": "s mind.\u201d \u201cPooh\u2014then he didn\u2019t mean it! \u2019Twas just a man\u2019s jest!\u201d \u201cYes he did; for he drove her a goodways towards the station.\u201d ", "21": "\u201cHe didn\u2019t take her!\u201d They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory symptoms, burst out crying. \u201cThere!\u201d said Mar", "22": "ian. \u201cNow I wish I hadn\u2019t told \u2019ee!\u201d \u201cNo. It is a very good thing that you have done! I have been living on in a thirtover, lack", "23": "aday way, and have not seen what it may lead to! I ought to have sent him a letter oftener. He said I could not go to him, but h", "24": "e didn\u2019t say I was not to write as often as I liked. I won\u2019t dally like this any longer! I have been very wrong and neglectful i", "25": "n leaving everything to be done by him!\u201d The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no longer. When Tess ", "26": "had reached home that evening, and had entered into the privacy of her little whitewashed chamber, she began impetuously writing", "27": " a letter to Clare. But falling into doubt, she could not finish it. Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she w", "28": "ore it next her heart, and retained it on her finger all night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really th", "29": "e wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz should go with him abroad, so shortly after he had left her. Kn", "30": "owing that, how could she write entreaties to him, or show that she cared for him any more? XLIV By the disclosure in the barn h", "31": "er thoughts were led anew in the direction which they had taken more than once of late\u2014to the distant Emminster Vicarage. It was", "32": " through her husband\u2019s parents that she had been charged to send a letter to Clare if she desired; and to write to them direct i", "33": "f in difficulty. But that sense of her having morally no claim upon him had always led Tess to suspend her impulse to send these", "34": " notes; and to the family at the Vicarage, therefore, as to her own parents since her marriage, she was virtually nonexistent. T", "35": "his selfeffacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing by way of ", "36": "favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts. She had set herself to stand or fall by her", "37": " qualities, and to waive such merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been established for her by the flimsy fact o", "38": "f a member of that family, in a season of impulse, writing his name in a churchbook beside hers. But now that she was stung to a", "39": " fever by Izz\u2019s tale, there was a limit to her powers of renunciation. Why had her husband not written to her? He had distinctly", "40": " implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a line to notify his", "41": " address. Was he really indifferent? But was he ill? Was it for her to make some advance? Surely she might summon the courage of", "42": " solicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and express her grief at his silence. If Angel\u2019s father were the good man sh", "43": "e had heard him represented to be, he would be able to enter into her heartstarved situation. Her social hardships she could con", "44": "ceal. To leave the farm on a weekday was not in her power; Sunday was the only possible opportunity. FlintcombAsh being in the m", "45": "iddle of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet, it would be necessary to walk. And the distance bein", "46": "g fifteen miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising early. A fortnight later, when", "47": " the snow had gone, and had been followed by a hard black frost, she took advantage of the state of the roads to try the experim", "48": "ent. At four o\u2019clock that Sunday morning she came downstairs and stepped out into the starlight. The weather was still favourabl", "49": "e, the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil. Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that the journ", "50": "ey concerned her husband. Their lodgings were in a cottage a little further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess in h", "51": "er departure, and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parentsinlaw; thoug", "52": "h she, knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare, was indifferent, and even doubtful. A year had now elapsed", "53": " since her sad marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very ", "54": "charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling a", "55": "gainst the pink skin of her face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat. \u201c\u2019Tis a thousand pities your husband can\u2019t see \u2019ee", "56": " now\u2014you do look a real beauty!\u201d said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she stood on the threshold between the steely starlight witho", "57": "ut and the yellow candlelight within. Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself to the situation; she could not be\u2014no ", "58": "woman with a heart bigger than a hazelnut could be\u2014antagonistic to Tess in her presence, the influence which she exercised over ", "59": "those of her own sex being of a warmth and strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine feelings of s", "60": "pite and rivalry. With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let her go; and she was absorbed into the pear", "61": "ly air of the foredawn. They heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her full pace. Even Izz hoped she", "62": " would win, and, though without any particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her fr", "63": "iend when momentarily tempted by Clare. It was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and only a few days less ", "64": "than a year that he had been absent from her. Still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a dry clear win"}, "112": {"1": "try morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs\u2019backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream at st", "2": "arting was to win the heart of her motherinlaw, tell her whole history to that lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back th", "3": "e truant. In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty", "4": " and still in the dawn. Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the atmosphere down there was a deep blue. Instead of the ", "5": "great enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to toil, there were little fields below her of less than hal", "6": "fadozen acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes of a net. Here the landscape was whiteybrown; down ", "7": "there, as in Froom Valley, it was always green. Yet it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape, and she did not love it", "8": " as formerly. Beauty to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in the thing, but in what the thing symbolized. Keeping the Vale o", "9": "n her right, she steered steadily westward; passing above the Hintocks, crossing at rightangles the highroad from ShertonAbbas t", "10": "o Casterbridge, and skirting Dogbury Hill and HighStoy, with the dell between them called \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Kitchen\u201d. Still following", "11": " the elevated way she reached CrossinHand, where the stone pillar stands desolate and silent, to mark the site of a miracle, or ", "12": "murder, or both. Three miles further she cut across the straight and deserted Roman road called LongAsh Lane; leaving which as s", "13": "oon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small town or village of Evershead, being now about h", "14": "alfway over the distance. She made a halt here, and breakfasted a second time, heartily enough\u2014not at the SowandAcorn, for she a", "15": "voided inns, but at a cottage by the church. The second half of her journey was through a more gentle country, by way of Benvill", "16": " Lane. But as the mileage lessened between her and the spot of her pilgrimage, so did Tess\u2019s confidence decrease, and her enterp", "17": "rise loom out more formidably. She saw her purpose in such staring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she was sometimes i", "18": "n danger of losing her way. However, about noon she paused by a gate on the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarag", "19": "e lay. The square tower, beneath which she knew that at that moment the Vicar and his congregation were gathered, had a severe l", "20": "ook in her eyes. She wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a weekday. Such a good man might be prejudiced against a w", "21": "oman who had chosen Sunday, never realizing the necessities of her case. But it was incumbent upon her to go on now. She took of", "22": "f the thick boots in which she had walked thus far, put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather, and, stuffing the former into", "23": " the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find them again, descended the hill; the freshness of colour she had derived ", "24": "from the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage. Tess hoped for some accident that might favour h", "25": "er, but nothing favoured her. The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in the frosty breeze; she could not feel by ", "26": "any stretch of imagination, dressed to her highest as she was, that the house was the residence of near relations; and yet nothi", "27": "ng essential, in nature or emotion, divided her from them: in pains, pleasures, thoughts, birth, death, and afterdeath, they wer", "28": "e the same. She nerved herself by an effort, entered the swinggate, and rang the doorbell. The thing was done; there could be no", "29": " retreat. No; the thing was not done. Nobody answered to her ringing. The effort had to be risen to and made again. She rang a s", "30": "econd time, and the agitation of the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles\u2019 walk, led her to support herself w", "31": "hile she waited by resting her hand on her hip and her elbow against the wall of the porch. The wind was so nipping that the ivy", "32": "leaves had become wizened and gray, each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves. A piece o", "33": "f bloodstained paper, caught up from some meatbuyer\u2019s dustheap, beat up and down the road without the gate; too flimsy to rest, ", "34": "too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it company. The second peal had been louder, and still nobody came. Then she walked", "35": " out of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through. And though she looked dubiously at the housefront as if inclined to retu", "36": "rn, it was with a breath of relief that she closed the gate. A feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized (though h", "37": "ow she could not tell), and orders been given not to admit her. Tess went as far as the corner. She had done all she could do; b", "38": "ut determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future distress, she walked back again quite past the house, l", "39": "ooking up at all the windows. Ah\u2014the explanation was that they were all at church, every one. She remembered her husband saying ", "40": "that his father always insisted upon the household, servants included, going to morningservice, and, as a consequence, eating co", "41": "ld food when they came home. It was, therefore, only necessary to wait till the service was over. She would not make herself con", "42": "spicuous by waiting on the spot, and she started to get past the church into the lane. But as she reached the churchyardgate the", "43": " people began pouring out, and Tess found herself in the midst of them. The Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congr", "44": "egation of small countrytownsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a st", "45": "ranger. She quickened her pace, and ascended the road by which she had come, to find a retreat between its hedges till the Vicar", "46": "\u2019s family should have lunched, and it might be convenient for them to receive her. She soon distanced the churchgoers, except tw", "47": "o youngish men, who, linked arminarm, were beating up behind her at a quick step. As they drew nearer she could hear their voice", "48": "s engaged in earnest discourse, and, with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation, did not fail to recognize in those ", "49": "noises the quality of her husband\u2019s tones. The pedestrians were his two brothers.

Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together. They soon reached the", "2": " summit of the hill, and, evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and turned all three", "3": " aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it.

She, who had heard thi", "9": "s, walked past under the screen of her woollen veil till, presently looking back, she perceived that the church party had left t", "10": "he gate with her boots and retreated down the hill. Thereupon our heroine resumed her walk. Tears, blinding tears, were running ", "11": "down her face. She knew that it was all sentiment, all baseless impressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as her ow", "12": "n condemnation; nevertheless she could not get over it; she could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untowar", "13": "d omens. It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage. Angel\u2019s wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hi", "14": "ll like a scorned thing by those\u2014to her\u2014superfine clerics. Innocently as the slight had been inflicted, it was somewhat unfortun", "15": "ate that she had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than the", "16": "y, and had to the full the gift of charity. As she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the ", "17": "quizzing to which they had been subjected, and felt how hopeless life was for their owner. \u201cAh!\u201d she said, still sighing in pity", "18": " of herself, \u201c_they_ didn\u2019t know that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these pretty ones _he_ bought for ", "19": "me\u2014no\u2014they did not know it!

If they had k", "20": "nown perhaps they would not have cared, for they don\u2019t care much for him, poor thing!\u201d Then she grieved for the beloved man whos", "21": "e conventional standard of judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her way without knowing that the grea", "22": "test misfortune of her life was this feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her estimating her fatheri", "23": "nlaw by his sons. Her present condition was precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and Mrs Clare. Thei", "24": "r hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among mankind ", "25": "failed to win their interest or regard. In jumping at Publicans and Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the ", "26": "worries of Scribes and Pharisees; and this defect or limitation might have recommended their own daughterinlaw to them at this m", "27": "oment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love. Thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had co", "28": "me not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis in her life was approaching. No crisis, apparently, had s", "29": "upervened; and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that starveacre farm till she could again summon courag", "30": "e to face the Vicarage. She did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to throw up her veil on this return journey, as if ", "31": "to let the world see that she could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could not show. But it was done with a sorry sha", "32": "ke of the head. \u201cIt is nothing\u2014it is nothing!\u201d she said. \u201cNobody loves it; nobody sees it. Who cares about the looks of a castaw", "33": "ay like me!\u201d Her journey back was rather a meander than a march. It had no sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency. Along the", "34": " tedious length of Benvill Lane she began to grow tired, and she leant upon gates and paused by milestones. She did not enter an", "35": "y house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of Evershe", "36": "ad, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such contrasting expectations. The cottage by the church, in which she again s", "37": "at down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looki", "38": "ng down the street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted. \u201cThe people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?\u201d she s", "39": "aid. \u201cNo, my dear,\u201d said the old woman. \u201c\u2019Tis too soon for that; the bells hain\u2019t strook out yet.

Nearing the central part, her echoes were intru", "43": "ded on by other sounds; and seeing the barn not far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher. His vo", "44": "ice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of the ", "45": "barn. The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest antinomian type; on justification by faith, as expounded in the the", "46": "ology of St Paul. This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory, fo", "47": "r he had plainly no skill as a dialectician.

He had, he said, been the ", "52": "greatest of sinners. He had scoffed; he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd. But a day of awakening had come,", "53": " and, in a human sense, it had been brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he had at first grossly i", "54": "nsulted; but whose parting words had sunk into his heart, and had remained there, till by the grace of Heaven they had worked th", "55": "is change in him, and made him what they saw him. But more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice, which, imposs", "56": "ible as it seemed, was precisely that of Alec d\u2019Urberville. Her face fixed in painful suspense, she came round to the front of t", "57": "he barn, and passed before it. The low winter sun beamed directly upon the great doubledoored entrance on this side; one of the ", "58": "doors being open, so that the rays stretched far in over the threshingfloor to the preacher and his audience, all snugly shelter", "59": "ed from the northern breeze. The listeners were entirely villagers, among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the red ", "60": "paintpot on a former memorable occasion. But her attention was given to the central figure, who stood upon some sacks of corn, f", "61": "acing the people and the door. The three o\u2019clock sun shone full upon him, and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer", "62": " confronted her, which had been gaining ground in Tess ever since she had heard his words distinctly, was at last established as", "63": " a fact indeed.

But such was unreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a converte", "2": "d man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear overcame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated", "3": " nor advanced. To think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last, and to behold it now!... There was the same", "4": " handsome unpleasantness of mien, but now he wore neatly trimmed, oldfashioned whiskers, the sable moustache having disappeared;", "5": " and his dress was halfclerical, a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract the dandyism from his ", "6": "features, and to hinder for a second her belief in his identity. To Tess\u2019s sense there was, just at first, a ghastly _bizarrerie", "7": "_, a grim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture out of such a mouth. This too familiar intonation, less t", "8": "han four years earlier, had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose that her heart became quite sick at the ir", "9": "ony of the contrast. It was less a reform than a transfiguration. The former curves of sensuousness were now modulated to lines ", "10": "of devotional passion. The lipshapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express supplication; the glow on the cheek t", "11": "hat yesterday could be translated as riotousness was evangelized today into the splendour of pious rhetoric; animalism had becom", "12": "e fanaticism; Paganism, Paulinism; the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with such mastery now bea", "13": "med with the rude energy of a theolatry that was almost ferocious.

Strange that their very elevation was a misapplication, that to raise see", "17": "med to falsify. Yet could it be so? She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer.

It was but the us", "19": "age of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes.

But the moment that she moved again ", "23": "he recognized her. The effect upon her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her. His fire, ", "24": "the tumultuous ring of his eloquence, seemed to go out of him. His lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it; ", "25": "but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him. His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung confusedly in eve", "26": "ry other direction but hers, but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds. This paralysis lasted, however, but a short ti", "27": "me; for Tess\u2019s energies returned with the atrophy of his, and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward. As so", "28": "on as she could reflect, it appalled her, this change in their relative platforms. He who had wrought her undoing was now on the", "29": " side of the Spirit, while she remained unregenerate. And, as in the legend, it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly", "30": " appeared upon his altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished.

All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive", "33": " sorrow; now there was a change in the quality of its trouble. That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time disp", "34": "laced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her. It intensified her consciousness of error to ", "35": "a practical despair; the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence, which she had hoped for, had not, after ", "36": "all, taken place. Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself. Thus absorbed, she recrossed the northe", "37": "rn part of LongAsh Lane at right angles, and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margi", "38": "n the remainder of her journey lay.

From the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the sha", "29": "pe of a ninepin, and was soon perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of FlintcombAsh. The man at the slicer", "30": ", having nothing else to do with his eyes, continually observed the comer, but Tess, who was occupied, did not perceive him till", "31": " her companion directed her attention to his approach.

XLVIII In the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be finished that night, since there was a moon by which ", "13": "they could see to work, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the morrow. Hence the twanging and humming a", "14": "nd rustling proceeded with even less intermission than usual. It was not till \u201cnammet\u201dtime, about three o\u2019clock, that Tess raise", "15": "d her eyes and gave a momentary glance round. She felt but little surprise at seeing that Alec d\u2019Urberville had come back, and w", "16": "as standing under the hedge by the gate.

Tess looked down again, and carefully abstained from gazing in that direction. Thus ", "18": "the afternoon dragged on. The wheatrick shrank lower, and the strawrick grew higher, and the cornsacks were carted away. At six ", "19": "o\u2019clock the wheatrick was about shoulderhigh from the ground.

She hardly knew where she was, and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that her hair was tumblin", "31": "g down. By degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and saucereyed.

And she did not vent this often; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and knew that his mind too", "55": " was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter. Only too often had she heard him lying awake at night, stifling sighs ", "56": "for Angel with prayers. But the uncompromising Evangelical did not even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his", "57": " son, an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the two others, when it was possible, if not probable, th", "58": "at those very advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had made it his life\u2019s mission and desire to propa", "59": "gate, and the mission of his ordained sons likewise. To put with one hand a pedestal under the feet of the two faithful ones, an", "60": "d with the other to exalt the unfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed to be alike inconsistent with his convictions, ", "61": "his position, and his hopes. Nevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and in secret mourned over this treatment of him as Abra", "62": "ham might have mourned over the doomed Isaac while they went up the hill together. His silent selfgenerated regrets were far bit", "63": "terer than the reproaches which his wife rendered audible. They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage. If Angel had never ", "64": "been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with agricultural girls. They did not distinctly know what had separa"}, "123": {"1": "ted him and his wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken place. At first they had supposed it must be something of t", "2": "he nature of a serious aversion. But in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her; ", "3": "from which expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly permanent as that. He had told", "4": " them that she was with her relatives, and in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation which they knew no w", "5": "ay of bettering. The eyes for which Tess\u2019s letter was intended were gazing at this time on a limitless expanse of country from t", "6": "he back of a mule which was bearing him from the interior of the SouthAmerican Continent towards the coast. His experiences of t", "7": "his strange land had been sad. The severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had never wholly left him", "8": ", and he had by degrees almost decided to relinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long as the bare possibility existed o", "9": "f his remaining, he kept this change of view a secret from his parents. The crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to", "10": " the country in his wake, dazzled by representations of easy independence, had suffered, died, and wasted away. He would see mot", "11": "hers from English farms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child would be stricken with fever and would d", "12": "ie; the mother would pause to dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands, would bury the babe therein with the same natur", "13": "al gravetools, shed one tear, and again trudge on. Angel\u2019s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern o", "14": "r eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English agri", "15": "culturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence. During this time of absence he had ment", "16": "ally aged a dozen years. What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos. Having long discredited ", "17": "the old systems of mysticism, he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they wanted readjusting. W", "18": "ho was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its", "19": " achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed. How, then, ab", "20": "out Tess? Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him. Did he reject her eternally, or di", "21": "d he not? He could no longer say that he would always reject her, and not to say that was in spirit to accept her now. This grow", "22": "ing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with her residence at FlintcombAsh, but it was before she had felt hersel", "23": "f at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her feelings. He was greatly perplexed; and in his perplexity", "24": " as to her motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire. Thus her silence of docility was misinterpreted. How much it", "25": " really said if he had understood!\u2014that she adhered with literal exactness to orders which he had given and forgotten; that desp", "26": "ite her natural fearlessness she asserted no rights, admitted his judgement to be in every respect the true one, and bent her he", "27": "ad dumbly thereto. In the beforementioned journey by mules through the interior of the country, another man rode beside him. Ang", "28": "el\u2019s companion was also an Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part of the island. They were both i", "29": "n a state of mental depression, and they spoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that curious tendency evinced ", "30": "by men, more especially when in distant lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account men", "31": "tion to friends, Angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage. The stranger had sojourned i", "32": "n many more lands and among many more peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm, so imme", "33": "nse to domesticity, were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountainchain to the whole terrestrial curve. He viewed", "34": " the matter in quite a different light from Angel; thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be", "35": ", and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from her. The next day they were drenched in a thunderstorm. Angel\u2019s c", "36": "ompanion was struck down with fever, and died by the week\u2019s end. Clare waited a few hours to bury him, and then went on his way.", "37": " The cursory remarks of the largeminded stranger, of whom he knew absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by", "38": " his death, and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the philosophers. His own parochialism made him ashamed by", "39": " its contrast. His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood. He had persistently elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of ", "40": "Christianity; yet in that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem. Surely then he might have regarded that a", "41": "bhorrence of the unintact state, which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at least open to correction when the res", "42": "ult was due to treachery. A remorse struck into him. The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled in his memory, came back to him", "43": ". He had asked Izz if she loved him, and she had replied in the affirmative. Did she love him more than Tess did? No, she had re", "44": "plied; Tess would lay down her life for him, and she herself could do no more. He thought of Tess as she had appeared on the day", "45": " of the wedding. How her eyes had lingered upon him; how she had hung upon his words as if they were a god\u2019s! And during the ter", "46": "rible evening over the hearth, when her simple soul uncovered itself to his, how pitiful her face had looked by the rays of the ", "47": "fire, in her inability to realize that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn. Thus from being her critic he grew t", "48": "o be her advocate. Cynical things he had uttered to himself about her; but no man can be always a cynic and live; and he withdre", "49": "w them. The mistake of expressing them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles to the disreg", "50": "ard of the particular instance. But the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone over the ground before today.", "51": " Clare had been harsh towards her; there is no doubt of it. Men are too often harsh with women they love or have loved; women wi", "52": "th men. And yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow; the h", "53": "arshness of the position towards the temperament, of the means towards the aims, of today towards yesterday, of hereafter toward", "54": "s today. The historic interest of her family\u2014that masterful line of d\u2019Urbervilles\u2014whom he had despised as a spent force, touched", "55": " his sentiments now. Why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things? ", "56": "In the latter aspect her d\u2019Urberville descent was a fact of great dimensions; worthless to economics, it was a most useful ingre", "57": "dient to the dreamer, to the moralizer on declines and falls. It was a fact that would soon be forgotten\u2014that bit of distinction", "58": " in poor Tess\u2019s blood and name, and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons ", "59": "at Kingsbere. So does Time ruthlessly destroy his own romances. In recalling her face again and again, he thought now that he co", "60": "uld see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced her granddames; and the vision sent that _aura_ through his veins ", "61": "which he had formerly felt, and which left behind it a sense of sickness.

A stupefactio", "56": "n had come into these features, to her regard; it meant the illness of her mother.

It was on one of the couchburning plots that she laboured with her fork", "22": ", its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks. Sometimes she was completely involved in", "23": " the smoke of her fire; then it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap. She was oddly dressed", "24": " tonight, and presented a somewhat staring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached by many washings, with a short black jacket ", "25": "over it, the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one.

Still the pr", "30": "ongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late; and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in", "31": " it that cheered the workers on. Something in the place, the hours, the crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and sh", "32": "ade, made others as well as Tess enjoy being there.

The eyes of all were on ", "34": "the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires.

She became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer. Sometimes the smoke div", "38": "ided them; then it swerved, and the two were visible to each other but divided from all the rest.

Byandby he dug so close to her that the firebeams were reflected as distinctly from the steel ", "42": "prongs of his fork as from her own. On going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she found that he did the sa", "43": "me on the other side. The fire flared up, and she beheld the face of d\u2019Urberville. The unexpectedness of his presence, the grote", "44": "squeness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the most oldfashioned of the labourers, had a ", "45": "ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing.

So do flux and reflux\u2014the rhythm of change\u2014alternate and persist in everyt", "19": "hing under the sky.

Thes", "23": "e annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here. When Tess\u2019s mother was a child the majority of the fieldfolk ab", "24": "out Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latter", "25": "ly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might p", "26": "ossibly be an advantage. The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance, till by resid", "27": "ence there it became in turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed. However, all the mutations so increasingly disce", "28": "rnible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had ", "29": "formerly contained, side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and betterinformed class, ranking distinctly ab", "30": "ove the former\u2014the class to which Tess\u2019s father and mother had belonged\u2014and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, t", "31": "he huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farmlabourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and", "32": " conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess\u2019s father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as t", "33": "he long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants, and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required", "34": " by the farmer for his hands. Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour, and the bani", "35": "shment of some starved the trade of others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who had formed the backbone of the ", "36": "village life in the past, who were the depositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large centres; the proc", "37": "ess, humorously designated by statisticians as \u201cthe tendency of the rural population towards the large towns\u201d, being really the ", "38": "tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery. The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner consi", "39": "derably curtailed by demolitions, every house which remained standing was required by the agriculturist for his workpeople. Ever", "40": " since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over Tess\u2019s life, the Durbeyfield family (whose descent was not ", "41": "credited) had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their lease ended, if only in the interests of morality.", "42": " It was, indeed, quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of temperance, soberness, or chastity. The f", "43": "ather, and even the mother, had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to church, and the eldest daughter had ", "44": "made queer unions. By some means the village had to be kept pure. So on this, the first LadyDay on which the Durbeyfields were e", "45": "xpellable, the house, being roomy, was required for a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan, her daughters Tess and \u2019LizaLu", "46": ", the boy Abraham, and the younger children had to go elsewhere. On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark beti", "47": "mes by reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. As it was the last night they would spend in the village which had been", "48": " their home and birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, \u2019LizaLu, and Abraham had gone out to bid some friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping", "49": " house till they should return. She was kneeling in the windowbench, her face close to the casement, where an outer pane of rain", "50": "water was sliding down the inner pane of glass. Her eyes rested on the web of a spider, probably starved long ago, which had bee", "51": "n mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement. Tess was refl", "52": "ecting on the position of the household, in which she perceived her own evil influence. Had she not come home, her mother and th", "53": "e children might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants. But she had been observed almost immediately on her re", "54": "turn by some people of scrupulous character and great influence: they had seen her idling in the churchyard, restoring as well a", "55": "s she could with a little trowel a baby\u2019s obliterated grave.

She was s", "58": "o intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the stre", "59": "et.

It was not till he touched the", "61": " window with his ridingcrop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his g", "62": "esture. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me?\u201d asked d\u2019Urberville. \u201cI was not attending,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard you, I believe, though I fancied it w", "63": "as a carriage and horses.

Here, of co", "19": "urse, he did not find her; and what added to his depression was the discovery that no \u201cMrs Clare\u201d had ever been heard of by the ", "20": "cottagers or by the farmer himself, though Tess was remembered well enough by her Christian name. His name she had obviously nev", "21": "er used during their separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention tha", "22": "n by the hardships she had chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather than apply to his father for mor", "23": "e funds.

It was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the gardens and foliage; the socalled spring was but winte", "31": "r overlaid with a thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his expectations. The house in which Tess had passed the y", "32": "ears of her childhood was now inhabited by another family who had never known her. The new residents were in the garden, taking ", "33": "as much interest in their own doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the histories of o", "34": "thers, beside which the histories of these were but as a tale told by an idiot. They walked about the garden paths with thoughts", "35": " of their own concerns entirely uppermost, bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behin", "36": "d them, talking as though the time when Tess lived there were not one whit intenser in story than now. Even the spring birds san", "37": "g over their heads as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular. On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom ev", "38": "en the name of their predecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John Durbeyfield was dead; that his widow and childre", "39": "n had left Marlott, declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of doing so had gone on to another place th", "40": "ey mentioned.

This fashionable wateringplace, with its eastern and its we", "14": "stern stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place", "15": " suddenly created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty. An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Wa", "16": "ste was close at hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a glittering novelty as this pleasure city ha", "17": "d chosen to spring up.

Yet the exotic had grown he", "19": "re, suddenly as the prophet\u2019s gourd; and had drawn hither Tess. By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of thi", "20": "s new world in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and tow", "21": "ers of the numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It was a city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lou", "22": "ngingplace on the English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was. The sea was near at hand, ", "23": "but not intrusive; it murmured, and he thought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same tones, and he thought ", "24": "they were the sea. Where could Tess possibly be, a cottagegirl, his young wife, amidst all this wealth and fashion? The more he ", "25": "pondered, the more was he puzzled. Were there any cows to milk here? There certainly were no fields to till. She was most probab", "26": "ly engaged to do something in one of these large houses; and he sauntered along, looking at the chamberwindows and their lights ", "27": "going out one by one, and wondered which of them might be hers. Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u2019clock he entered", "28": " and went to bed. Before putting out his light he reread Tess\u2019s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not\u2014so near her, ye", "29": "t so far from her\u2014and he continually lifted the windowblind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind w", "30": "hich of the sashes she reposed at that moment.

But he had a vague consciousness of one t", "9": "hing, though it was not clear to him till later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him ", "10": "as hers\u2014allowing it to drift, like a corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living will.

His face grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment, and a minu", "12": "te or two after, he found himself in the street, walking along he did not know whither. LVI Mrs Brooks, the lady who was the hou", "13": "seholder at The Herons and owner of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually curious turn of mind. She was t", "14": "oo deeply materialized, poor woman, by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon ProfitandLoss, to retain much cu", "15": "riousity for its own sake, and apart from possible lodgers\u2019 pockets. Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her wellpaying te", "16": "nants, Mr and Mrs d\u2019Urberville, as she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the", "17": " feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade. Tess had spoken to her hu", "18": "sband from the doorway, without entering the diningroom, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partlyclosed door of her own sitti", "19": "ngroom at the back of the passage, could hear fragments of the conversation\u2014if conversation it could be called\u2014between those two", "20": " wretched souls. She heard Tess reascend the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front", "21": " door behind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had reentered her apartment. As the yo", "22": "ung lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time. She accordingly ascended the stai", "23": "rs softly, and stood at the door of the front room\u2014a drawingroom, connected with the room immediately behind it (which was a bed", "24": "room) by foldingdoors in the common manner. This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks\u2019s best apartments, had been taken by the wee", "25": "k by the d\u2019Urbervilles. The back room was now in silence; but from the drawingroom there came sounds. All that she could at firs", "26": "t distinguish of them was one syllable, continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a soul bound to some I", "27": "xionian wheel\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d The landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a s", "28": "mall space of the room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table, which was already spread ", "29": "for the meal, and also a chair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess\u2019s face was bowed, her posture being a kneeling one in fro", "30": "nt of it; her hands were clasped over her head, the skirts of her dressinggown and the embroidery of her nightgown flowed upon t", "31": "he floor behind her, and her stockingless feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet. It was from her l", "32": "ips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair. Then a man\u2019s voice from the adjoining bedroom\u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She did not", "33": " answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy rather than an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy.

Mrs Brooks, thinking that the speaker was coming to rush out of ", "45": "the door, hastily retreated down the stairs. She need not have done so, however, for the door of the sittingroom was not opened.", "46": " But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing again, and entered her own parlour below. She could hear nothing through ", "47": "the floor, although she listened intently, and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted breakfast. Coming up pres", "48": "ently to the front room on the ground floor she took up some sewing, waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might take away th", "49": "e breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to discover what was the matter if possible. Overhead, as she sat, she could now hea", "50": "r the floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were walking about, and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of g", "51": "arments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of the front door, and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her wa", "52": "y into the street. She was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a welltodo young lady in which she had arrived, with the ", "53": "sole addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn. Mrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell,", "54": " temporary or otherwise, between her tenants at the door above. They might have quarrelled, or Mr d\u2019Urberville might still be as", "55": "leep, for he was not an early riser. She went into the back room, which was more especially her own apartment, and continued her", "56": " sewing there. The lady lodger did not return, nor did the gentleman ring his bell. Mrs Brooks pondered on the delay, and on wha", "57": "t probable relation the visitor who had called so early bore to the couple upstairs. In reflecting she leant back in her chair. ", "58": "As she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface wh", "59": "ich she had never noticed there before. It was about the size of a wafer when she first observed it, but it speedily grew as lar", "60": "ge as the palm of her hand, and then she could perceive that it was red. The oblong white ceiling, with this scarlet blot in the", "61": " midst, had the appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts. Mrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving. She got upon the table, and ", "62": "touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers. It was damp, and she fancied that it was a blood stain. Descending from the ta", "63": "ble, she left the parlour, and went upstairs, intending to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber at the back of the ", "64": "drawingroom. But, nerveless woman as she had now become, she could not bring herself to attempt the handle. She listened. The de"}, "134": {"1": "ad silence within was broken only by a regular beat. Drip, drip, drip. Mrs Brooks hastened downstairs, opened the front door, an", "2": "d ran into the street. A man she knew, one of the workmen employed at an adjoining villa, was passing by, and she begged him to ", "3": "come in and go upstairs with her; she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers. The workman assented, and followed he", "4": "r to the landing. She opened the door of the drawingroom, and stood back for him to pass in, entering herself behind him. The ro", "5": "om was empty; the breakfast\u2014a substantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham\u2014lay spread upon the table untouched, as when sh", "6": "e had taken it up, excepting that the carvingknife was missing. She asked the man to go through the foldingdoors into the adjoin", "7": "ing room. He opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost instantly with a rigid face. \u201cMy good God, the gentle", "8": "man in bed is dead! I think he has been hurt with a knife\u2014a lot of blood has run down upon the floor!\u201d The alarm was soon given,", "9": " and the house which had lately been so quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the rest. The wound wa", "10": "s small, but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as if he had sc", "11": "arcely moved after the infliction of the blow. In a quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to ", "12": "the town had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every street and villa of the popular wateringplace. LVII Meanwhile Angel C", "13": "lare had walked automatically along the way by which he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast, staring ", "14": "at nothingness. He went on eating and drinking unconsciously till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took h", "15": "is dressingbag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him, and went out. At the moment of his departure a telegram wa", "16": "s handed to him\u2014a few words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his address, and informing him that his brother", "17": " Cuthbert had proposed to and been accepted by Mercy Chant. Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station; r", "18": "eaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour and more. He sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter", "19": " of an hour felt that he could wait there no longer. Broken in heart and numbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but he wished to g", "20": "et out of a town which had been the scene of such an experience, and turned to walk to the first station onward, and let the tra", "21": "in pick him up there. The highway that he followed was open, and at a little distance dipped into a valley, across which it coul", "22": "d be seen running from edge to edge. He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and was climbing the western acclivit", "23": "y when, pausing for breath, he unconsciously looked back. Why he did so he could not say, but something seemed to impel him to t", "24": "he act. The tapelike surface of the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see, and as he gazed a moving spot intruded o", "25": "n the white vacuity of its perspective. It was a human figure running. Clare waited, with a dim sense that somebody was trying t", "26": "o overtake him. The form descending the incline was a woman\u2019s, yet so entirely was his mind blinded to the idea of his wife\u2019s fo", "27": "llowing him that even when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire in which he now beheld her.", "28": " It was not till she was quite close that he could believe her to be Tess. \u201cI saw you\u2014turn away from the station\u2014just before I g", "29": "ot there\u2014and I have been following you all this way!\u201d She was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he did ", "30": "not ask her a single question, but seizing her hand, and pulling it within his arm, he led her along. To avoid meeting any possi", "31": "ble wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some firtrees. When they were deep among the moaning boughs he sto", "32": "pped and looked at her inquiringly. \u201cAngel,\u201d she said, as if waiting for this, \u201cdo you know what I have been running after you f", "33": "or? To tell you that I have killed him!\u201d A pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke. \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, thinking from the str", "34": "angeness of her manner that she was in some delirium. \u201cI have done it\u2014I don\u2019t know how,\u201d she continued. \u201cStill, I owed it to you", "35": ", and to myself, Angel. I feared long ago, when I struck him on the mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the tra", "36": "p he set for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me. He has come between us and ruined us, and now he can never ", "37": "do it any more. I never loved him at all, Angel, as I loved you. You know it, don\u2019t you? You believe it? You didn\u2019t come back to", "38": " me, and I was obliged to go back to him. Why did you go away\u2014why did you\u2014when I loved you so? I can\u2019t think why you did it. But", "39": " I don\u2019t blame you; only, Angel, will you forgive me my sin against you, now I have killed him? I thought as I ran along that yo", "40": "u would be sure to forgive me now I have done that. It came to me as a shining light that I should get you back that way. I coul", "41": "d not bear the loss of you any longer\u2014you don\u2019t know how entirely I was unable to bear your not loving me!

Is he dead?\u201d \u201cYes. He heard me crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and called you by a foul name; and th", "45": "en I did it. My heart could not bear it. He had nagged me about you before. And then I dressed myself and came away to find you.", "46": "\u201d By degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted, at least, what she said she had done; and his horror at ", "47": "her impulse was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which ", "48": "had apparently extinguished her moral sense altogether. Unable to realize the gravity of her conduct, she seemed at last content", "49": "; and he looked at her as she lay upon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and wondered what obscure strain in the d\u2019Urbervill", "50": "e blood had led to this aberration\u2014if it were an aberration. There momentarily flashed through his mind that the family traditio", "51": "n of the coach and murder might have arisen because the d\u2019Urbervilles had been known to do these things. As well as his confused", "52": " and excited ideas could reason, he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she spoke, her mind had lost its balance, ", "53": "and plunged her into this abyss. It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. But, anyhow, here was this des", "54": "erted wife of his, this passionatelyfond woman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to her but a prote", "55": "ctor. He saw that for him to be otherwise was not, in her mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was absolutely dom", "56": "inant in Clare at last. He kissed her endlessly with his white lips, and held her hand, and said\u2014 \u201cI will not desert you! I will", "57": " protect you by every means in my power, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!\u201d They then walked on under t", "58": "he trees, Tess turning her head every now and then to look at him. Worn and unhandsome as he had become, it was plain that she d", "59": "id not discern the least fault in his appearance. To her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and mentally. He", "60": " was still her Antinous, her Apollo even; his sickly face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no", "61": " less than when she first beheld him; for was it not the face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely, and who had beli", "62": "eved in her as pure! With an instinct as to possibilities, he did not now, as he had intended, make for the first station beyond", "63": " the town, but plunged still farther under the firs, which here abounded for miles. Each clasping the other round the waist they", "64": " promenaded over the dry bed of firneedles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the consciousness of being together a"}, "135": {"1": "t last, with no living soul between them; ignoring that there was a corpse. Thus they proceeded for several miles till Tess, aro", "2": "using herself, looked about her, and said, timidly\u2014 \u201cAre we going anywhere in particular?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, dearest. Why?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019", "3": "t know.\u201d \u201cWell, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or other\u2014in a lonely cottage, ", "4": "perhaps. Can you walk well, Tessy?\u201d \u201cO yes! I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!\u201d Upon the whole it seemed a g", "5": "ood thing to do. Thereupon they quickened their pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure paths tending more or less nort", "6": "hward. But there was an unpractical vagueness in their movements throughout the day; neither one of them seemed to consider any ", "7": "question of effectual escape, disguise, or long concealment. Their every idea was temporary and unforefending, like the plans of", "8": " two children. At midday they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have entered it with him to get something to eat, but ", "9": "he persuaded her to remain among the trees and bushes of this halfwoodland, halfmoorland part of the country till he should come", "10": " back. Her clothes were of recent fashion; even the ivoryhandled parasol that she carried was of a shape unknown in the retired ", "11": "spot to which they had now wandered; and the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle of a tavern. He s", "12": "oon returned, with food enough for halfadozen people and two bottles of wine\u2014enough to last them for a day or more, should any e", "13": "mergency arise. They sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal. Between one and two o\u2019clock they packed up the remain", "14": "der and went on again. \u201cI feel strong enough to walk any distance,\u201d said she. \u201cI think we may as well steer in a general way tow", "15": "ards the interior of the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to be looked for than anywhere near the coas", "16": "t,\u201d Clare remarked. \u201cLater on, when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.\u201d She made no reply to this beyond that of", "17": " grasping him more tightly, and straight inland they went. Though the season was an English May, the weather was serenely bright", "18": ", and during the afternoon it was quite warm. Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken them into the dept", "19": "hs of the New Forest, and towards evening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large board ", "20": "on which was painted in white letters, \u201cThis desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished\u201d; particulars following, with directions to a", "21": "pply to some London agents. Passing through the gate they could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and large", "22": " accommodation. \u201cI know it,\u201d said Clare. \u201cIt is Bramshurst Court. You can see that it is shut up, and grass is growing on the dr", "23": "ive.\u201d \u201cSome of the windows are open,\u201d said Tess. \u201cJust to air the rooms, I suppose.\u201d \u201cAll these rooms empty, and we without a ro", "24": "of to our heads!\u201d \u201cYou are getting tired, my Tess!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop soon.\u201d And kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwa", "25": "rds. He was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen miles, and it became necessary to consider what the", "26": "y should do for rest. They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns, and were inclined to approach one of the latte", "27": "r, when their hearts failed them, and they sheered off. At length their gait dragged, and they stood still. \u201cCould we sleep unde", "28": "r the trees?\u201d she asked. He thought the season insufficiently advanced. \u201cI have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed,\u201d ", "29": "he said. \u201cLet us go back towards it again.\u201d They retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood without the ent", "30": "rancegate as earlier. He then requested her to stay where she was, whilst he went to see who was within. She sat down among the ", "31": "bushes within the gate, and Clare crept towards the house. His absence lasted some considerable time, and when he returned Tess ", "32": "was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for him. He had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as care", "33": "taker, and she only came there on fine days, from the hamlet near, to open and shut the windows. She would come to shut them at ", "34": "sunset. \u201cNow, we can get in through one of the lower windows, and rest there,\u201d said he. Under his escort she went tardily forwar", "35": "d to the main front, whose shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility of watchers. The door was reache", "36": "d a few steps further, and one of the windows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess in after him. Except the h", "37": "all, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended the staircase. Up here also the shutters were tightly closed, the ventila", "38": "tion being perfunctorily done, for this day at least, by opening the hallwindow in front and an upper window behind. Clare unlat", "39": "ched the door of a large chamber, felt his way across it, and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches. A shaft o", "40": "f dazzling sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy, oldfashioned furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous fou", "41": "rpost bedstead, along the head of which were carved running figures, apparently Atalanta\u2019s race. \u201cRest at last!\u201d said he, settin", "42": "g down his bag and the parcel of viands. They remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to shut the window", "43": "s: as a precaution, putting themselves in total darkness by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should open the door ", "44": "of their chamber for any casual reason. Between six and seven o\u2019clock she came, but did not approach the wing they were in. They", "45": " heard her close the windows, fasten them, lock the door, and go away. Then Clare again stole a chink of light from the window, ", "46": "and they shared another meal, till byandby they were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to disperse. LVII", "47": "I The night was strangely solemn and still. In the small hours she whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his ", "48": "sleep with her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of both their lives, and laid her down in the stone cof", "49": "fin at the ruined abbey.

Why should w", "51": "e! Who knows what tomorrow has in store?\u201d But it apparently had no sorrow. The morning was wet and foggy, and Clare, rightly inf", "52": "ormed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the house, lea", "53": "ving Tess asleep.

In the night the dull sky cleared, and the result was that the old caretaker at the cotta", "6": "ge awoke early. The brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open the contiguous mansion immediately, and to a", "7": "ir it thoroughly on such a day. Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower rooms before six o\u2019clock, she ascende", "8": "d to the bedchambers, and was about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment she fancied she could hear th", "9": "e breathing of persons within. Her slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far, and she made for", "10": " instant retreat; then, deeming that her hearing might have deceived her, she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handl", "11": "e. The lock was out of order, but a piece of furniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her opening the doo", "12": "r more than an inch or two. A stream of morning light through the shutterchink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in profo", "13": "und slumber, Tess\u2019s lips being parted like a halfopened flower near his cheek. The caretaker was so struck with their innocent a", "14": "ppearance, and with the elegance of Tess\u2019s gown hanging across a chair, her silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and th", "15": "e other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else, that her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and va", "16": "gabonds gave way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it seemed. She closed the door, and withdrew as s", "17": "oftly as she had come, to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery. Not more than a minute had elapsed after her ", "18": "withdrawal when Tess woke, and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them, though they could not say what; a", "19": "nd the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two ", "20": "or three inches of shutterchink. \u201cI think we will leave at once,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is a fine day. And I cannot help fancying somebod", "21": "y is about the house. At any rate, the woman will be sure to come today.\u201d She passively assented, and putting the room in order,", "22": " they took up the few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly. When they had got into the Forest she turned to ", "23": "take a last look at the house. \u201cAh, happy house\u2014goodbye!\u201d she said. \u201cMy life can only be a question of a few weeks. Why should w", "24": "e not have stayed there?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say it, Tess! We shall soon get out of this district altogether. We\u2019ll continue our course as w", "25": "e\u2019ve begun it, and keep straight north. Nobody will think of looking for us there. We shall be looked for at the Wessex ports if", "26": " we are sought at all. When we are in the north we will get to a port and away.\u201d Having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued", "27": ", and they kept a beeline northward. Their long repose at the manorhouse lent them walking power now; and towards midday they fo", "28": "und that they were approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in their way. He decided to rest her in a clu", "29": "mp of trees during the afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare purchased food as usual, and their nigh", "30": "t march began, the boundary between Upper and MidWessex being crossed about eight o\u2019clock. To walk across country without much r", "31": "egard to roads was not new to Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The intercepting city, ancient Melchester", "32": ", they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed the", "33": "m. It was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping off the pavement ", "34": "that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it was lo", "35": "st upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the turnpikeroad, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain. Tho", "36": "ugh the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon ", "37": "had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their", "38": " way along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no ", "39": "hedge or fence of any kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a stiff breeze blew. They had proceede", "40": "d thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front, ri", "41": "sing sheer from the grass. They had almost struck themselves against it. \u201cWhat monstrous place is this?\u201d said Angel. \u201cIt hums,\u201d ", "42": "said she. \u201cHearken!\u201d He listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming tune, like the note of some gigantic on", "43": "estringed harp. No other sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare felt the vertical surface o", "44": "f the structure. It seemed to be of solid stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found that what he ha", "45": "d come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining.", "46": " At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the", "47": " pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be ", "48": "still out of doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said\u2014 \u201cWhat can it be?\u201d Feelin", "49": "g sideways they encountered another towerlike pillar, square and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The", "50": " place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous architraves. \u201cA very Temple of the Winds,\u201d he said. The nex", "51": "t pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a car", "52": "riage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple ", "53": "advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst. \u201cIt is Stonehenge!\u201d said Clare. \u201cThe heathen temp", "54": "le, you mean?\u201d \u201cYes. Older than the centuries; older than the d\u2019Urbervilles! Well, what shall we do, darling? We may find shelte", "55": "r further on.\u201d But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered ", "56": "from the wind by a pillar. Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the stone was warm and dry, in comforting co", "57": "ntrast to the rough and chill grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go any further, Angel,\u201d she ", "58": "said, stretching out her hand for his. \u201cCan\u2019t we bide here?\u201d \u201cI fear not. This spot is visible for miles by day, although it doe", "59": "s not seem so now.\u201d \u201cOne of my mother\u2019s people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of it. And you used to say at Talbothays t", "60": "hat I was a heathen. So now I am at home.\u201d He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon hers. \u201cSleepy are y", "61": "ou, dear? I think you are lying on an altar.\u201d \u201cI like very much to be here,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt is so solemn and lonely\u2014after my ", "62": "great happiness\u2014with nothing but the sky above my face. It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish th", "63": "ere were not\u2014except \u2019LizaLu.\u201d Clare thought she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter, and he flung his ov", "64": "ercoat upon her, and sat down by her side. \u201cAngel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over \u2019LizaLu for my sake?\u201d she aske"}, "137": {"1": "d, when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars. \u201cI will.\u201d \u201cShe is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel\u2014I w", "2": "ish you would marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!\u201d \u201cIf I lose you I lose all! And she is my siste", "3": "rinlaw.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, dearest. People marry sisterlaws continually about Marlott; and \u2019LizaLu is so gentle and sweet, and sh", "4": "e is growing so beautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, An", "5": "gel, and bring her up for your own self!... She had all the best of me without the bad of me; and if she were to become yours it", "6": " would almost seem as if death had not divided us... Well, I have said it. I won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d She ceased, and he fell in", "7": "to thought. In the far northeast sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform concavity of black cl", "8": "oud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot, letting in at the earth\u2019s edge the coming day, against which the towering monolith", "9": "s and trilithons began to be blackly defined. \u201cDid they sacrifice to God here?\u201d asked she. \u201cNo,\u201d said he. \u201cWho to?\u201d \u201cI believe t", "10": "o the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.\u201d \u201cThis remin", "11": "ds me, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married? But I knew your ", "12": "mind all the same, and I thought as you thought\u2014not from any reasons of my own, but because you thought so. Tell me now, Angel, ", "13": "do you think we shall meet again after we are dead? I want to know.\u201d He kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time. \u201cO, Angel\u2014I ", "14": "fear that means no!\u201d said she, with a suppressed sob. \u201cAnd I wanted so to see you again\u2014so much, so much! What\u2014not even you and ", "15": "I, Angel, who love each other so well?\u201d Like a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical time he did not an", "16": "swer; and they were again silent. In a minute or two her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed, and she f", "17": "ell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and ne", "18": "ar; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. T", "19": "he eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light, and the great flameshaped Sunstone beyond them; an", "20": "d the Stone of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the quivering little pools in the cuplike hollows of the", "21": " stones lay still. At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward\u2014a mere dot. It was the head of a m", "22": "an approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sunstone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in the circumstances decided to ", "23": "remain quiet. The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were. He heard something behind him, the brus", "24": "h of feet. Turning, he saw over the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware, another was at hand on the right", "25": ", under a trilithon, and another on the left. The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and Clare could discern from", "26": " this that he was tall, and walked as if trained. They all closed in with evident purpose. Her story then was true! Springing to", "27": " his feet, he looked around for a weapon, loose stone, means of escape, anything. By this time the nearest man was upon him. \u201cIt", "28": " is no use, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are sixteen of us on the Plain, and the whole country is reared.\u201d \u201cLet her finish her sleep!\u201d ", "29": "he implored in a whisper of the men as they gathered round. When they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they", "30": " showed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars around. He went to the stone and bent over her, holding on", "31": "e poor little hand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a lesser creature than a woman. All waited in the growin", "32": "g light, their faces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their figures dark, the stones glistening greengray, t", "33": "he Plain still a mass of shade. Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her unconscious form, peering under her eyelids ", "34": "and waking her. \u201cWhat is it, Angel?\u201d she said, starting up. \u201cHave they come for me?\u201d \u201cYes, dearest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have come.\u201d ", "35": "\u201cIt is as it should be,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAngel, I am almost glad\u2014yes, glad! This happiness could not have lasted. It was too much", "36": ". I have had enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!\u201d She stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of ", "37": "the men having moved. \u201cI am ready,\u201d she said quietly. LIX The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital of Wes", "38": "sex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the brightness and warmth of a July morning. The gabled brick, tile, and", "39": " freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in th", "40": "e sloping High Street, from the West Gateway to the medi\u00e6val cross, and from the medi\u00e6val cross to the bridge, that leisurely du", "41": "sting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an oldfashioned marketday. From the western gate aforesaid the highwa", "42": "y, as every Wintoncestrian knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a measured mile, leaving the houses ", "43": "gradually behind. Up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if unconscious of the trying ", "44": "ascent\u2014unconscious through preoccupation and not through buoyancy. They had emerged upon this road through a narrow, barred wick", "45": "et in a high wall a little lower down. They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind, and this roa", "46": "d appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so. Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads, which gait of grief th", "47": "e sun\u2019s rays smiled on pitilessly. One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding creature\u2014half girl, half woman\u2014a sp", "48": "iritualized image of Tess, slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes\u2014Clare\u2019s sisterinlaw, \u2019LizaLu. Their pale faces se", "49": "emed to have shrunk to half their natural size. They moved on hand in hand, and never spoke a word, the drooping of their heads ", "50": "being that of Giotto\u2019s \u201cTwo Apostles\u201d. When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the clocks in the town struck", "51": " eight. Each gave a start at the notes, and, walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first milestone, standing whitely ", "52": "on the green margin of the grass, and backed by the down, which here was open to the road. They entered upon the turf, and, impe", "53": "lled by a force that seemed to overrule their will, suddenly stood still, turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the st", "54": "one. The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. In the valley beneath lay the city they had just left, its more promine", "55": "nt buildings showing as in an isometric drawing\u2014among them the broad cathedral tower, with its Norman windows and immense length", "56": " of aisle and nave, the spires of St Thomas\u2019s, the pinnacled tower of the College, and, more to the right, the tower and gables ", "57": "of the ancient hospice, where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale. Behind the city swept the rotund up", "58": "land of St Catherine\u2019s Hill; further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hangi", "59": "ng above it. Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city edifices, a large redbrick building, with l", "60": "evel gray roofs, and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the ", "61": "quaint irregularities of the Gothic erections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks,", "62": " but it was visible enough up here. The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this structure. From th", "63": "e middle of the building an ugly flattopped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this spot, on its", "64": " shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot on the city\u2019s beauty. Yet it was with this blot, and not with the beau"}, "138": {"1": "ty, that the two gazers were concerned. Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes were riveted on it. A f", "2": "ew minutes after the hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the breeze. It was a black fl", "3": "ag. \u201cJustice\u201d was done, and the President of the Immortals, in \u00c6schylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess. And the d\u2019Urberv", "4": "ille knights and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing. The two speechless gazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in ", "5": "prayer, and remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently.
